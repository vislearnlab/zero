tulip004,bloodpressurecuff,1," This item is typically a band that goes around your arm, and it's made of velcro, plastic,  and it basically is like a rectangle, I guess. This object is used for measuring someone's blood pressure in order to see if it's high  or if it's low, and it's typically used by nurses before you enter the doctor's office."
tulip004,bloodpressurecuff,2," So, this object is a band that goes around your arm.  It's pretty long, so it can wrap all the way around, and then it has a little dial on it in order to see if it's high or low.  You can also see what the blood pressure is, and it also has like a little rubber ball,  I guess, that can be squeezed. This object is used to measure someone's blood pressure in order to see if it's high or if it's low.  Usually, if it's on the higher side, that is something bad, and it's usually used by nurses."
tulip004,stethoscope,1,"A stethoscope is something that usually goes around a doctor's neck and it's kind of like a longer shape and it has two parts that go into a person's ear and then the other part is like a silver part at the end that's placed on a person's heart and that typically listens to the person's heartbeat. When this object is used it goes in someone's ears like I said there's two parts and then the bottom part at the end is placed on a person's heart and it listens to their heartbeat to see if they have any regular or irregular heart."
tulip004,stethoscope,2,"A stethoscope is a long object that has two plastic pieces that go in your ear and then at the end of it there is a silver part that's what listens to a person's heart and it's made of rubber plastic and metal I would say. A stethoscope is used by listening to someone's heartbeat in order to see if they have any regular or irregular heart. It is regular or irregular and to see the heartbeat patterns it's typically used by either doctors or nurses."
tulip004,crankflashlight,1,"From my knowledge I would say that a crank flashlight is similar to a flashlight that's used in an outdoor setting. It would have light beams at the end. It would probably be used with batteries. I would say that a crank flashlight is used in times of darkness when light is needed. Maybe if there's no light or if the power goes out or something like that."
tulip004,crankflashlight,2,"crank in order to turn a flashlight on so it doesn't look like a typical flashlight that would just have like a rubber button you press. I would imagine that when you crank it like the light beams at the end turn on and that is how it would be used. I imagine that a crank flashlight is used again when it is dark outside or maybe if you're camping or in a small space or there is no lighting and you just need something with light."
tulip004,floppydisk,1," So, a floppy disk is a  So, circular shape. I'm not really sure what it can be used for but if I had a guess it'd probably be maybe like some type of like toy or object that can be used since it is a floppy disk it can't be something that looks like a CD. honest I'm not really sure what a floppy disk is other than what I previously said it might be like an object that a kid would use."
tulip004,floppydisk,2,"After seeing this object on the table it looks to be a square shape and now for more understanding it looks like it might have something to do with maybe a printer or something like that. It does say print life on it and I kind of do see like an inserting part like a it can be like a like a microchip or like a flash drive that can be like inserted into something. I would imagine that this object can be used for something with a printer. Maybe you insert it into the printer and it does something it might be like a piece to something or something that stores information on it."
tulip004,shoehorn,1," For a shoehorn, I'm not exactly what this object would look like.  If I had to imagine what it could potentially be, I might say that it's a smaller item.  Maybe it's something that helps you put your shoes on or your dress shoes on, something that goes on the back so you don't crease it.  I would imagine that a shoehorn is used to put shoes on, maybe more like dress shoes  or something, in order to not crease the shoes and it would be an easier slip into the shoe, especially if they're a tighter form of a shoe. Okay."
tulip004,shoehorn,2," So, this is a shoehorn.  This object is typically made of metal or plastic, although it really does depend on the brand or just the price of the item. It can differ. This object is used in order to help put your shoes on.  So, basically, you're holding one end and the other end goes at the top of the back part of the shoe and then you just basically put the heel of your foot on it and you slide your heel into the shoe. And it goes on easier than trying to do it yourself."
tulip004,handmixer,1," So, this object usually looks like a plastic part at the top that has two spindles, um,  like, going below that can, like, rotate within each other and mix an item, and basically the top of the item where the plastic is has a handle,  and you would go ahead and, like, hold that handle, and you would turn the button on at the top, and you would use it that way.  Basically, a hand mixer is kind of an older version of what we would see of today's more modern, like, KitchenAid item or something,  so you would turn a button on, and you would, like, hand mix, um, dough, whether that's, like, for cookies or brownies or cake or etc."
tulip004,handmixer,2," So, this object has two metal rotators.  It's at the bottom, and the top is a plastic handle, and it has a crank as well, so you would put it in the dough,  and basically you would, like, crank or turn the dough or the batter or whatever that you're trying to make.  And it can be made out of, like, plastic, and then the bottom spindles would be metal.  This object is used in a kitchen setting, so more likely when you're baking rather than cooking because it is a hand mixer."
tulip004,fishingreel,1," A fishing reel is going to look like a long rod, maybe like about like eight to ten feet and basically the top part of it it's gonna have like a thin fishing line going all the way down that's what's going to help catch a fish or an item an animal like in a lake or a river and it's gonna have like bait on the end that you put on yourself and then towards the end it's going to have like a handle reel that you basically like reel and crank in order to like bring something out of the water this item is going to be used by turning the crank it's gonna have like almost like a cylinder I want to say where the crank is at and you basically turn that and it's gonna like pull the reel in like back towards you and it's gonna take an object"
tulip004,fishingreel,2,"this item before what I had described I guess was a fishing pole a fishing reel is just the part it's like a circle like a cylinder basically and it has little thin like lining put into it that like in or out and then as I stated before it has a crank that is what you use with your hand in order to pull the little thin line like in or out and it is usually made of metal I would say this object I would say goes on a fishing pole and it can be used to I guess pull out animals such as like fish or something from the lake and it basically has like little like wiring like wire like thin like a thin piece of material that pulls things"
tulip004,rolodex,1,"I personally do not have a lot of experience with this item. I don’t know what it is and I would say I don’t have a guess either.Bases on my last  item I also would not say that I do not know how this item is used or what it is used for."
tulip004,rolodex,2,"This item is made of plastic and it has two rotating spinners on each side and in the middle of that on a horizontal line it has little like flash card looking pieces of paper that go through the alphabet and each letter has a different tab to it and it seems like information  could be stored on each one. So, for example, something started with like a P and maybe you were writing like a recipe or something for potatoes like you would put it under the P section so it almost seems as if it's like a little storage thing or you could also use it in an office setting.  It looks like this item is used to store information, data, it could be recipes, phone numbers, people's contact information. It basically just keeps everything in like a little storage space from A through Z."
tulip004,bulbplanter,1,"I'm not 100% sure what this object would look like but I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is like when I think of planter,   I kind of think of gardening and when I think of bulb, like I think of an onion bulb. So, maybe it's something that like grows something at the start before it's like transferred into like a planter or something to garden with.  So, maybe it would be made out of like plastic and you would have to put like soil in it. I think it's something that I would imagine that it would be used in the beginning stages before they have to be like transplanted or transferred out as they get bigger."
tulip004,bulbplanter,2,"This object is a cylinder shape that's maybe about a ruler length tall, maybe around like 10 inches, I want to say vertically.  And it's hollow in the middle and on the side, it has like inches or like centimeters on it as like you're going to measure something.  And then that part is made out of metal and then at the top, it's going to be made out of like a plastic handle.  I think this object works by putting it on soil or dirt, probably soil because it does seem like it is a gardening tool. And you would basically take the handle where the plastic part is and push down into it.  And since the middle part is hollow, I would imagine that it would kind of like create that cylinder shape in the soil and then it would like help you plant like something, whether that's like an onion or something like that."
tulip004,threeholepunch,1,"a three hole punch can look like different versions the one that immediately comes up in my head is the bottom part is kind of like plastic and it is like 12 inches long and it has like the the inches and the centimeters on it and then on the left side it has like three holes and then there's gonna be like a handle at the top basically and so it would be made out of like plastic and metal and then it would have like measurements on it so you could like correctly align a piece of paper this object works in order to punch holes in it so for example a lined piece of paper already has holes but if you want to take a regular blank sheet of white paper and put it in there you could hole punch it and then you'd have three holes on the side and it would allow you to put then put that paper into the paper and then you can just like put it in there and then you can just like put it into a binder or a folder or something with like three rings"
tulip004,threeholepunch,2,"this object typically looks like it has three holes in it so it will punch three holes into a piece of paper the three hole punch that I was shown seems like a simpler model of what I was shown so basically you just have to push down on it after putting a piece of paper and that's correctly aligned and it'll put those holes into a paper again this object is used to punch holes in the paper the purpose of this would be to put it into a binder such as a three ring binder and yeah"
tulip004,pocketradio,1,"this item is typically going to look like a smaller version of a radio so when you see the word pocket it's going to be something smaller so typically a little like radio that can be like handheld put in a purse put in your pocket um taking whatever on the go it's not going to look like a typical i guess radio or speaker and i'm not sure the material would be made out of i might say like rubber and something else maybe plastic i think it just kind of depends i would imagine that a pocket radio is used in order to play music um maybe from your phone maybe from bluetooth um if it's an older model it might have to be connected to something with a wire"
tulip004,pocketradio,2,"this item is an old school radio um it functions through fn and am and it it seems battery operated it's usually going to be made out of plastic this object works by turning on a button on the radio and it does need batteries in it and once it turns on you have a little power dial that you can obviously use to lower the sound or raise the sound and there's also going to be like a little button in order to change the channels like fm or am"
tulip004,frenchpress,1,"when i think of french press i think of hair immediately so i'm gonna say it's gonna be like maybe like 12 inches long probably made out of plastic it might have a wire at the end to be plugged in I think that this object is used for a person's hair maybe in order to like put waves in it or you know like change the style from like curly or straight"
tulip004,frenchpress,2,"this item appears to be made out of plastic um the it's like a cylinder almost again and it's like the top is something that you can open and put something in um potentially like coffee beans or like coffee roast or something like that and it seems like it might be like an old older style like item um in order to make coffee or maybe like grind like the coffee espresso or something I again would imagine that this item is used in order to make a type of coffee it does appear like it might be like a 1900s or like maybe early 2000s model I'm not exactly sure but I would imagine that it's used to like press coffee"
tulip005,handmixer,1,"A hand mixer is... It has like these attachments that are made out of... Made out of metal. There's typically like two like attachments. Sometimes they're like swirls. Sometimes it's like a... Like a tetrahedral type of shape. And then it has like a grip that you can hold onto while the attachments spin. How does the object work? It's used for cooking or baking more so. It basically spins. The attachments spin. So it like mixes the... Whatever you're making."
tulip005,handmixer,2,"I was referring to one of those electric ones but now I know theres also some manual ones that you rotate. Same thing, it has like an attachment to spin. It's made out of metal typically. It's very similar to a mixing whisk. Sometimes it has plastic on it. It's used for baking to mix. You essentially rotate the handle on the side to get the whisk portion of it to spin. Used for baking."
tulip005,floppydisk,1," I think this is like a metal, tiny piece of metal that you plug into your computer. I'm not entirely sure. It's typically metal. You put it into the side of your computer. It's like a rectangular shape.  Used to, like, transfer data. Um... You plug it into the side of a computer. Um..."
tulip005,floppydisk,2,"It is to transfer data. It's like a square shape. It goes in the computer.  Sometimes it can go with other things, I guess. It can also go on cameras to transfer data.  Basically, you transfer data on it and then you can transfer that data from device to device.  Yeah, to transfer data from device to device."
tulip005,threeholepunch,1,"It's typically long. It has two portions of it. There's a bottom portion and there's the top portion that you push down. You insert paper in there. It punches three holes. There's typically three holes on the bottom portion to align where you want the holes. It's to make holes in your paper.  If you want to add paper into a binder, you push down on the top portion, align it with the three holes on the bottom portion. And you push down on it and it creates holes in the paper."
tulip005,threeholepunch,2,"It has these hinges. connecting the top and the bottom portion. You push down on these hinges and it creates like the holes in the paper. It has some like I guess it contains the paper. You can't push it like farther in or nor can you like only like use two holes like you have to adjust the paper in there to punch the holes. Yeah you have to like push the paper in there. You push it on the hinges and it creates the holes."
tulip005,shoehorn,1," It's typically just a long piece, like sometimes it's wood, sometimes it's metal. It has like an indentation in it for like where your ankle goes. It's used to assist in putting on shoes.  While you're putting on shoes, you place it against your heel. And put the shoe on how you normally would just put it in the shoe. It just helps not crease like if it's leather or anything. Also it just helps slide the ankle in."
tulip005,shoehorn,2," Yeah, made out of metal has like an indentation for where your ankle goes. Helps slide it in. There's also like a curve to it to kind of follow the natural curve of like your ankle. So it helps assist the ankle slide into the shoe. Yeah."
tulip005,stethoscope,1," Um, it typically has like this rubber material surrounding it.  It has, it follows like a Y shape.  You, there's two like buds that you put into your ear.  And then on the bottom, like on the bottom of the Y, there's like a circular shape. Um.  looks kind of like a bell almost. It's used to measure your heart, heart rate I  guess, to hear the heart."
tulip005,stethoscope,2," There's like a rubber portion on the top, followed by like metal. There's like these  rubber like buds for you, for the ears. The circular portion on the bottom, there's like  the bottom is made out of metal, it's like a circular portion, but then it like, it expands out almost to like a bigger circle.  Used to hear the heart, but then also just like noises within the body. You can also  use it to hear like the stomach, just different parts of the body to hear."
tulip005,bulbplanter,1," Um, I genuinely don't know what this is. Um, I think it's probably for like flowers. I assume it's like similar to like a shovel. Hmm. probably to assist with like planting like plants like tulips"
tulip005,bulbplanter,2,"um it's a cylindrical shape um there's like ridges on the bottom to assist um yeah there's like ridges on the bottom um there's a handle on top of like the cylinder um it's like a plastic material um um i believe it's to help like take the dirt out when planting bulb plants. So you would stick it into the ground and then I believe it would take dirt out to where you can put the seed in."
tulip005,crankflashlight,1,"It has like a glass side to it where light peeks out of. Um.  It has like a plastic, it's like a plastic cylindrical shape with glass on top. There's like a button on the side to turn it on and off.  You turn it on and off to like, for extra light I guess. Use it in like dimly. Or like. Like dark areas to see better as it produces like light."
tulip005,crankflashlight,2,"Um.  Yeah, it follows like a circular, ovular shape. Um.  There is a handle on the side that you turn, um, to turn on the flashlight.  There is a, um, circular, um, handle to like help hold, um, the flashlight on the end of it.  So there's the, there's the circle on one side and the glass on the other side. Um.  You crank the, you crank the handle. So.  Or crank the, like lever, on the side. Um it produces light. Um.  So, kind of a manual flashlight."
tulip005,bloodpressurecuff,1,"It is like a cloth material that you wrap around your arm. The cloth is like connected with a wire.  The wire is typically surrounded by a rubber material and it is connected to a device, like a rectangular device.  Typically it has buttons, like an on off button. On one side it shows the top and the bottom numbers for blood pressure. Okay. You wrap it around your arm and it fills with air. It kind of looks for a pulse when it first hears the pulse versus when it last hears the pulse. It is like the top and the bottom number. Essentially to measure your blood pressure. Sometimes it also has like a pulse on there."
tulip005,bloodpressurecuff,2,"Um same thing, there’s like a cloth on it to like help keep the cuff in place. Um, connected by like a wire covered in rubber. There’s like a bulb that you push air into the cuff with and there’s also like, I think a circle with like  So I tried to explore many different cultures, and I did not see enough stuff.  numbers on it and as you release air, the pin or the needle on the circular device lowers.  How it works? You push air into the cuff with the bulb, you squeeze it to push air into the cuff. Once you're around 200 or so, you release the air. There's a needle, like a little screw thing on the side that you undo to release the air. It releases air when you first start...oh you put the buds in your ear as well.  When you first hear the sound of the buds, you release air. You pull the air out of your ears. That's the top number. The bottom number is when you last hear the noise."
tulip005,fishingreel,1,"usually... a long rod. It's typically like metal or plastic. It's a long rod. It has a handle on the side that you crank. It has a... a string connected to it. And then a hook connected to the string. You essentially... use a fishing reel to... to fish. You... pull back the hook and then you push it forward to release the string as far as it can go.  Once you feel a pull on the string, you use the handle bar on the side to reel in the string. Usually there's a fish connected to the hook. Like the metal hook."
tulip005,fishingreel,2," Yeah, there's a handle bar on the side. You... There's a handle bar on the side. There is a... It's circular. It's cylindrical. There's a rod on... or the handle on the side that you can turn. It's like a cylindrical shape. Put the handle on the side. There is... like... rubber on the top where you can put in the reel.  Or the actual hook, I'm assuming. And then there's a bottom part where the string goes. You turn the handle to... unravel the string. To... throw the string... to unravel the string so it can go as far out as possible into the water. You... turn the handle towards you to reel the string back in to collect fish."
tulip005,frenchpress,1,"I'm not entirely sure what this is. I think maybe like metal that you use to iron. I think it's used for ironing clothes to get wrinkles out."
tulip005,frenchpress,2,"So it's like a long cylindrical glass. With like a plastic handle.  There are, there's like a spout almost to pour out the liquid that's in there. There is a top with like a lid.  The lid is connected to this, it's connected to like these like circular, like a spring type. So it's like a spring inside.  I believe if like you press the button, like it should like spin, spin the springs within, maybe help like mix whatever is in like the container. And then you can like pour it out through the spout. Just use the handle to hold it."
tulip005,pocketradio,1,"Um typically made… it’s like a rectangular shape or it has like it comes in on the bottom it has like these wire like like a mesh type of situation where like the audio comes out of sometimes it has like a little antenna on it that like pokes out from the top very small like a fit in your hand I think you can like there has like like knobs that you can turn for like different stations it essentially picks up like radio waves from different stations you turn the knob left or right to like change the radio station it plays whatever is on the radio at the time there's like an AM setting there's usually an FM setting just like a volume setting you can essentially just listen to the radio it's very tiny like in the travel size you can take it with you"
tulip005,pocketradio,2,"typically made out of plastic or metal there are some holes that like allow the the sound to come out um there's like these wheels on the side to adjust to adjust like FM AM like the Hertz um there's also like a button on the side or like a hinge almost like you turn it off and not like push it up or down um to turn the radio on and off it has um an antennas poking out and then like just some string attached to it to hold to help hold on to it um reaches out to different or yeah connects to like different Hertz um which kind of determines like AM or FM um to yeah play sound play music out of the device um the antenna kind of helps um connect to different stations"
tulip005,rolodex,1,"I'm not entirely sure what this is. I believe it's maybe like a watch. Like a circular shape connected by like straps with numbers on it and needles. Maybe it's to tell time."
tulip005,rolodex,2,"You spin the wheel to kind of rotate the flashcards if you want to go to the next flashcard. It usually has information on the cards. It's held up by these two like. Pillars.  The pillars are made out of metal, but the wheels are typically made out of plastic.  It helps keep information, I guess. You flip through it to get through information. You spin the wheel to get through information faster.  If there's a contact, you can flip.  If there is a contact that starts with a specific letter, you can flip to that letter, and it will have the information on it."
tulip006,shoehorn,1,"A shoe horn?  I can't, like I'm guessing it's a horn, but I can't remember specifically what the horn looks like.  Assuming that it's a horn, I'm guessing it's some sort of thing that we blow out of. I don't know if it's necessarily like brass or if it's like even like out of like an actual horn.  Yeah, I can't think of anything else out of a shoe horn. I'm just going based off that it's a horn. So I'm guessing it's some sort of noise. That it’s trying to produce."
tulip006,shoehorn,2," Well, it seems to be metal.  And low-key kind of resembles, I guess, like the shape of like a shoe in terms of it having  like a longer top part and then like a different part towards the back that's not as long, assuming that's the back. And then the shorter part has like a hole.  And then also when looking at the object, it seems to be like flat, but then it's bent. It's bent... How do you even describe that? It's bent where I would imagine like the difference between like where the heel is and the... The heel on the front part of the foot.  And then it's also bent in the middle, kind of like a taco. I don't know what else to say for that.  I would love to know, but I have no idea."
tulip006,bloodpressurecuff,1," Um, so blood pressure cuff,  it's usually like, um,  some sort of material, um,  that's like a flat tube usually,  um, that can be inflated later,  and then that thing has like, um,  a gauge usually on it, or is it sometimes separate?  I, I usually see like the gauge on top of the, um,  the inflatable tube that's flat, and then you can put it on the arm.  And then around that tube there's this, like,  um, connection to another tube that has at the end,  like a, um, something that you can squeeze,  I forget what you call it, to like put air into it.  Um, and then you increase it, um,  you keep on squeezing it to put air into the, um,  the inflatable thing that's around,  the person's arm,  and then, um, the gauge shows how much pressure is in it.  Um, I think that's it.  Describe how the object works,  Okay, what it's used for.  Um, so it's used for, um,  like, counting, it's used for figuring out the blood pressure.  Um, I'm trying to remember. I've had it done on me before.  I think they, um, put, put the cuff on to restrict circulation,  and then my hand is over,  and then they try to find, like, an, like, an artery or something,  like, they can get a sense of where my pulse is,  and then they bring it up to a certain threshold, I'm assuming,  and then, um, when it's restricted enough, then they can  And, like, feel the pulse, um,  when they release it or something like that,  and then they count the amount of pulses over, I think,  like, a minute.  Um, and that is an indication of my blood pressure. I could be totally wrong.  Okay, cool."
tulip006,bloodpressurecuff,2," So it's usually made out of, um, some sort of material. I guess it could be plastic.  Um, I guess I don't really see any other material.  Um, for the material that goes around the arm. Okay. So it's basically just a tube.  Um, I initially said, like, a tube, but I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be a tube.  It's just, like, something that wraps around and then there's something that's inflatable  that causes, like, tension, um, or, like, compresses the arm that restricts blood flow.  Um, and then it has that connected nozzle.  I initially said it was, like, the gauges on the, um, on the actual thing, on the actual material that's attached on the arm.  But I guess it does make a lot more sense for it to be, two separate things  Um, two separate, like, connections, um, from the material that's around the arm. And then one is the gauge and the other is the inflatable squishy thing. I can't think of the word.  Um, and then you, you squeeze the inflatable thing to inflate the, the thing on the arm that constricts blood flow.  And then there's also the gauge that shows, um,   the, um, the amount of pressure.  And then also back to the, the squeezing thing that has, like, a, a thing to release air pressure.  Um, I don't think I want to say anything different.  Um, you put it around the arm, um, the patient's arm, and then you inflate it. and then inflating it by constricting blood flow. And then you inflate it by squeezing the nozzle.  And then you bring it to a certain point, which you base off of the gauge.  And then once you reach a certain point, you constrict blood flow for a certain threshold.  The person who's trying to find your blood pressure finds your, like an artery or whatever,  to find a pulse, and they count the pulse. I think it's before or after they release the air pressure. There's like a nozzle on the squeezing thing. I feel like I'm so... I'm so bad at explaining this. And I think that's it. And I think that's it. I can't imagine anything else."
tulip006,handmixer,1,"Hand mixer.  The only things that are coming to mind is, like, a whisk or...  Sorry, thank you. It looks... It looks... It looks like a...  A handle, which can be made of whatever material.  And then there's usually some sort of, like, wire that's bent in, like, a... Almost like a light bulb shape.  But it's, like, bent around, like, a perimeter in a circular motion so that, like, ultimately has, like, a shape of a bulb. And then... That's also usually made of metal. But hand mixer?  The only other thing I could think of of a hand mixer is, like...  Instead of a whisk would be, like, the actual machine which has, like, a base of a bowl. And then...  Oh, wait. Hand mixer. Maybe... Maybe the base of the bowl. And then...  It has, like, a contraption that goes on top.  And it, like, has maybe some sort of whisk.  Or some sort of, like... Thing that mixes I don't know.  Well, it's definitely used to mix things that I guess that you would typically mix with your hands. I'm assuming it's usually made for dough. Can't really think of too much else in that."
tulip006,handmixer,2,"Okay so the hand mixer it’s typically im guessing it’s made out of metal. I can imagine it being made out of other things but not really. It has… it definitely has a handle, um, and then it has a grip that’s attached to gears that um that like automatically spin separate whisks that are at the other end, um. I don’t know how much else I can describe after that… It's like a bike. After that... Grips. Metal. Gears. Turning the whisks. Yeah. Um... I don't think that's going to change. Um... It's just used for... Um... Mixing things that I guess would otherwise be mixed with hands. Um... It works... By... Um... You don't necessarily have to hold...  But, like, by turning the... Um... Turning the handle that's attached to the gear that automatically spins the... Excuse me. Um...  Spins the whisks, which then mixes whatever they need, like, for dough or something. Okay."
tulip006,threeholepunch,1,"Looks like and made of…  So it's typically, like, an elongated thing. I can only imagine it being used with metal and maybe some sort of plastic.  It's elongated, like, specifically to the length of, like, a paper because what it... Okay. Um...  It has, like, these metal...  It has, like, a metal... How do I say this?  It's elongated, and then it has a sort of, like, folding function  that can, like, fold in onto...  Oh, my God. Wait. What am I saying?  Elongated part, length of a... Uh...  A piece of paper, usually, made out of metal or plastic.  It's a flat surface that usually has, like, three holes.  And then there's, like, a second thing that you use to fold onto that flat surface.  But that second thing that you fold onto has, like, three protruding things that are usually metal that fit into the bottom... The bottom flat layer. And... And that usually punctures three holes. Yeah. How it works and what it's... Um... You fold it onto a piece of paper. Or you fold it onto whatever you're trying to puncture. Um...  And you, like, put it in and then at the hinge, fold into and then punctures into it for the three holes. Um... Used for... Usually paper. Um...  I can't think of anything else you really, really use a hole puncher for. Other than paper. Especially a three-hole puncher."
tulip006,threeholepunch,2," So it's usually made out of metal or plastic, but that one seemed like it was mostly metal. It looks made in looks. That's what it's made of.  And then looks like it has the bottom flat layer,  and then those things have the three little holes, but that also the bottom layer has a removable section to get rid of the things that were punched out.  And then on top is some sort of contraption,  that pushes down onto the three holes, usually with corresponding three little pieces of metal. I noticed that there were springs that was used.  Yeah, you should press down on the handle, because the handle... The handle on the top. I can't think of anything else. How it works and what it's used for. You insert the paper into the three-hole puncher.  It's about the same length of a piece of paper, so it's pretty easy to just put it in where it needs to be.  And you press down,  and it punches out, Three little holes  And then you insert the paper into the three little holes,  and then maybe you also include the fact that it has the removable bottom, because it has the things that you punched out. Okay."
tulip006,crankflashlight,1,"Crank flashlight. Used and made of.  So, it's  made of, um,  well, specifically, it's made out of plastic. Or metal. I guess also glass for the bulb and I guess the lens that protects the bulb. Like it also. Could be plastic. Um. Maybe there's a bit of rubber for the grip. Um.  It then looks like, um, well, flashlight.  So, like a long cylindrical base and then maybe like a bell for where, whatever end has the, um, the bulb. Um. I'm trying to think.  I'm guessing somewhere it's attached, um, some sort of crank handle. Um. Similar to the hand whisk.  And, yeah. Okay.  So, it works by. You.  Cranking the handle and then that creates like kinetic energy, which.  Um, produces kinetic energy that is like converted and produce produced into light. Um. For the flashlight.  Um, and then what is it used for?  Um, it's used like a flashlight, um, to. Um. Bring light or like to. Use for light.  Um, but I guess specifically crank flashlight would be when electricity is not available. Like no batteries available.  So it's can be used whenever, as long as you can crank it."
tulip006,crankflashlight,2,"Um. So it works by. Um. Cranking the handle. Um. And that creates. Um.  Kinetic energy, which I guess can also be. Um. Stored into some sort of battery. Um. It also has a solar panel. So it can. Um. Also get energy from that and the sun. Um. And then there's the button that turns it on or off. So you don't have to necessarily turn rely on constantly just cranking it And that way it stores energy And what it's used for is. Um. For. Light. Like any other flashlight. But specifically when you don't have. Like. Like an external source of energy. Um. Readily available. Yeah."
tulip006,pocketradio,1," Oh, geez. Pocket radio? Okay. Looks and made. Made?  I mean, internal components probably like a battery or metal. Pocket radio.  Plastic, metal. I don't really think that I probably have a battery. Otherwise The wires. Yeah. Anything else? What does it look like?  Well, it's a pocket, so I'm guessing it has to be portable. Probably has to fit into pockets so it's smaller. I don't know if I would generalize any sort of shape. Definitely has some sort of speaker area. Probably some sort of screen too.  Oh, I guess plastic. It may be plastic for that. Okay. Some sort of screen to show what station you are on.  Then again, I guess it could just be a dial that has like the numbers of the stations  that you're trying to tune into or signal, whatever frequency. And then... I'm trying to think. It's just used for... How do you use it?  Well, I mean, you press the button to turn it on and then it plays whatever radio thing you need.  I mean, there's probably some sort of way that you can plug it in if it has... If you need to charge it.  And then it's used for entertainment, listening to music, but I guess also communication."
tulip006,pocketradio,2,"So it's smaller. It's made out of plastic.  plastic and metal, maybe, I don't really see anything else, there is a bit of, um, for the  rope it was, or, like, the, yeah, the rope, it was, like, made out of some other material, I can't think of, um,  for how it looks, it's, it looked like a box, and had speaker, had the antenna,  um, had the, the dial, like I said, that shows what, um,  frequency it's on, had, like, a sort of, not, like, a, a tech, like, not, like, an electric,  electronic screen, but, like, some sort of, like, area that shows what frequency it was tuning into,  um, there's a few holes for, like, I'm guessing charging, or some sort of ports,  what frequency, um, you also turn on the power button,  and that's how it works, I mean, you can also extend the antenna, um, if you need to get better  signal, and then what it's used for, same thing, um, just, uh, entertainment, um, because you can  tune into, like, a radio station, and then maybe some sort of communication if you're trying to"
tulip006,fishingreel,1,"um made of plastic um fishing reels made of plastic I'm assuming if I even know what that is um and I guess if we're talking about like how it comes in it's like wrapped around um like a tube thing I don't know how you describe it um that holds it it's like a tube and then there's like things on the end to make sure it doesn't fall off and it's wrapped around that and fishing reel specifically is um like a usually clear I think um plastic string um looks like made of yeah long long piece of string plastic string um I mean specifically specifically for fishing um it's used on a fishing pole um and it's like attached to the pole and how does it work and what is it used for work I mean it's used as um I guess to connect the fishing pole to the fishing hook um and the whole point of it is that um you can reel in the hook from the fishing pole um it's used for fishing um I guess you can also use it for just tying anything in general um yeah cool"
tulip006,fishingreel,2,"looks like and made of so definitely made out of plastic for specifically I was thinking fishing line That's what I was thinking of.  It has a like a fishing line, which is plastic and then everything else seems to be pretty much made of metal. What does it look like? It’s pretty complicated.  So it's attached to the pole, but it like juts out and it has a handle that like you can crank. And then it has the fishing reel and then it has like this sort of contraption around it that either like releases or receives the fishing line back in. It's all metal. Can't think of anything else. So you crank the handle and it either it spins the contraption around the fishing line one or two ways. There's also like a thing that like it's like almost like a flip that goes over and under it. I think that's like if it holds it or if it releases it. The line. And cranking it and that turns the fishing line either in or out. And then what it's used for fishing. It's used on a fishing pole to reel in or like release the fishing hook on the fishing pole. Okay."
tulip007,pocketradio,1," I'm not really sure what this is, but I would assume that it is made of some form  of metal, maybe like a little plastic, let's say? I guess it's something that's really small for people to bring around to either listen to the radio music or any news."
tulip007,pocketradio,2," It's a little cuboid shape with a little rod poking out from the top, and then it seems  like it's mostly made of plastic, maybe some metal inside. Yeah. We can see that on the object there's the FM and AM. That's something that can be used to either listen to the radio or listen to the news or just getting any signals around from the satellite."
tulip007,bloodpressurecuff,1,"This thing looks like it has a little sleeve that you can put on your arm. The material seems to be more like nylon or like cotton type. It's more soft. And then with like... It's more like a screen with something to press or like check the blood pressure and I think heart rate. The blood pressure cuff gets on your arm.  The sleeve gets on your arm, and then it tightens to see and then checks your blood pressure and likely heart rate."
tulip007,bloodpressurecuff,2,"It seems to be made of some form of like soft type of...  material, I'm not really sure what the material is, with like a little squeeze ball and also I don't know what it's called but the scale thing that you can see like what the blood pressure is. You put the sleeve on your arm and then hold the squeeze ball and then when the thing tightens you can see what the blood what your blood pressure is."
tulip007,fishingreel,1,"Not really sure what this is but probably likely made of metal since it likely needs to go under water or it is also likely that it's made of some form of plastic. It is likely used to help fish. I mean yeah."
tulip007,fishingreel,2," It seems to be made of metal, mostly metal and likely a little plastic and then a thing can spin around. Seems to be a little heavy as well. Just to help fish or like help bring the fishing rod back up when you fish. When the thing spins and you can pull pull it back or like retract the rod."
tulip007,handmixer,1,"It is mostly made of metal with either like a- it's either fully made of metal or it's fully made of plastic. It's a little more difficult to wash a small sense of like how it is shaped. It is used to mix ingredients together typically either when baking or cooking. When cooking typically like beating eggs or when like baking it would be typically to beat eggs as well or to just ensure the ingredients are well mixed."
tulip007,handmixer,2,"It seems to be mostly made of stainless steel especially the part that needs to touch the food and the handles seems to be plastic. The object- when you spin the handle- the mixer type of thing spins as well. That helps mix the ingredients or like food together well."
tulip007,floppydisk,1,"Likely made of metal? Not really sure whether or not this is the correct thing I'm- the correct thing I'm thinking of. But likely made of metal and- Yeah. It's to put a disc or like a CD or like a DVD to watch something."
tulip007,floppydisk,2,"It's more of a square shaped really thin mostly made of plastic maybe a little bit of metal on top at the back. Uh.  It seems like it's more similar to a hard disk where it stores information, either pictures,  videos, or files."
tulip007,threeholepunch,1," It's mostly made of metal, maybe the handle is plastic. It's used to punch holes in papers or cards.  You can punch three holes at the same time to either bind documents together or something, or arts and crafts."
tulip007,threeholepunch,2," It's really big and long, mostly made of metal. It's pretty heavy as well with a little compartment to store the punched papers or cards. It’s used to…  to punch, it's used to poke holes into papers or cards, either to bind documents together or for any form of arts and crafts."
tulip007,bulbplanter,1," Not really sure what this is, but I guess maybe made of metal or some form of rubber, I guess? My guess is that... It's...  It's used to help put the bulb into the light or the lamp, so it's easier or it's not as hot or dangerous."
tulip007,bulbplanter,2," It seems to be mostly made of metal, likely like steel or something, with like the handle  that's made of rubber, and then there's numbers at the side, maybe to just give a good measurement of like how big the light bulb is and control how it holds it. It's likely used to light a light bulb up to a lamp or like a light.  So with like the rubber handle, it seems to like make it safer since so it's not as hot when if the bulb is... If the light is like just got turned off."
tulip007,shoehorn,1,"Not too sure what this is. Likely made of plastic since it's probably gonna be close to human contact so likely to help you wear your shoes easier so you don't have to like bend down too much and like hurt your back or something."
tulip007,shoehorn,2,"it is made of metal and it's like a little dent maybe to help put the shoe in easier. it seems to help us wear shoes easier if we don't want to bend down too much or the shoe is really tight so it's easier to wear our shoes with it."
tulip007,frenchpress,1,"I have no idea what this is just by the name. I assume it's probably made of metal. I guessing maybe used to press something but can't really guess what's pressing them so."
tulip007,frenchpress,2,"It seems to be mostly made of glass. And then maybe a rubber handle. The inside is likely made of stainless steel. With a little rod that you can pull up and down with a little sieve inside.  After looking at it, I think it's to help make tea or coffee. And then the little sieve in there would probably just sieve out any tea leaves or coffee. Coffee beans or like crushed coffee beans."
tulip007,rolodex,1," Uh, I have no idea what this is. Can't really give a good guess of what it might be made of. So. Don't know what this is.  Also, can't really guess what it's used for."
tulip007,rolodex,2,"Uh seems to have like a plastic handle on the side and maybe like a little metal to ensure that the thing is rigid uh also with like index cards in the middle and then um with like something in the middle with like an alphabetical order with like different alphabets  Oh, i'm guessing it's either to help take notes or just have like or maybe like client information since it's in alphabetical order or maybe just like take notes of like materials or something like that"
tulip007,crankflashlight,1,"So I'm guessing that it's probably has a handle on the side uh holding the flashlight or maybe Mostly made of metal or mostly made of plastic I'm guessing that it might be like a handheld uh Manual type of flashlight where you have to like spin the thing or like spin the handle"
tulip007,crankflashlight,2,"it's pretty small it has a little handle at the side that you can spin It's a kind of like a little solar panel on the side as well Aw I think it's mostly made of plastic and then like the light bulb in front.  I think it's like a non, just a flashlight that does not use electricity and uses like sunlight or solar power. Maybe for when you go hiking or something where you can't get electricity or like if electricity might run out or like the batteries might die."
tulip007,stethoscope,1,"It should be mostly made of metal and then it's like something that you can put over your ears and then a thing to listen to.  It’s likely used to listen to heartbeats, doctors use it a lot to hear how fast a patient's heart rate might be."
tulip007,stethoscope,2," I think it's like a non, just a flashlight that does not use electricity and then a thing to listen to.  Seems to have like, most, the part where you used to listen to seems to be made of metal and then like the,  uh,  things, that leads to like the thing that you put on the patient's body.  Uh,  it's mostly made of rubber, maybe to like contain the noise or something.  Um,  the thing that you put into your ear,  that's, that seems to be made of rubber.  Uh,  it's used to,  it's used by doctors or any health practitioners,  uh, to listen to heartbeats or heart rates of patients."
tulip008,fishingreel,1," So I'm gonna say, uh, a long shaft with a, a reel on it, uh, with a bunch of string inside of the, the reel and going up the rod.  Uh, the handle's usually rubber or I think it's wood.  Um, but the, the handle's a lot thicker than the, than the end of the rod.  Uh, the object works by throwing the, it's called the fly, into the water and the entire string will follow that into the water.  And then once you feel some resistance on the, on the string, you pull back and you rotate the, uh, the, the reel and the, the top of the string comes up hopefully with a fish."
tulip008,fishingreel,2,"I think the string is some sort of plastic. It's used for fishing."
tulip008,bloodpressurecuff,1,"I'm going to say it's black with a band that goes around your arm. And I think it's made of some sort of plastic or fabric.  The object works by, I believe it's pumping air into the place that stores it.  And I'm not sure how it does this, but I think it figures out what the pressure is  by resisting what's inside of your arm, the pressure inside your arm."
tulip008,bloodpressurecuff,2,"I think before I said that it was just the part  that goes around your arm,  I forgot about the valve that you actually put air, that you use to put air into the band. And I also forgot the gauge to measure your actual pressure. And looking at it I'm realizing it's in millimeters of mercury rather than psi or bar or pascal. The object typically looks like a black band with a valve and a gauge on it and it's made of plastic and metal. The object works by pumping air into the valve and seeing the resulting pressure."
tulip008,stethoscope,1,"the object looks like two plugs that go into your ears with wires hanging down. They sit around your chest and join together. From there there's this one tube connected to some sort of thing that will amplify the sound in your heart. The object works by amplifying the sound in your heart and you're able to see or hear your heartbeat."
tulip008,stethoscope,2,"The object looks like two plugs that go into your ear and then a metal piece at the bottom that will go on your chest. Then connecting the plugs and the part that goes in your chest is just tubes The object works by amplifying the sound of your heartbeat by measuring the sound from your chest and then bringing that up to your ear."
tulip008,frenchpress,1,"The object looks like I want to say a canister with a handle at the top. I know you bring that up and push it back down and somehow it pulls the flavor from the beans. I think it's made of glass and metal. The object works by putting some sort of combination of water and beans in there. I'm not sure where exactly you put it in. But then you lift the handle and you push it back down and it will infuse the water with the beans. Just used for making coffee."
tulip008,frenchpress,2,"The object typically looks like the canister with the handle at the top and handle at the side and a spout. It's made of plastic and more plastic and the metal into it. The object works by raising and lowering the handle to make coffee."
tulip008,threeholepunch,1,"The object looks like... I guess it's a metal device and you put paper in it. And then it's got a big handle at the top and you push that down and it'll punch holes in your paper.  The object works by putting paper in the device, pushing down, and then it'll punch your holes."
tulip008,threeholepunch,2,"The object is gray and black made out of metal.  In the area where it punches the holes, it's got a sharp rounded cylinder with a sharp surface at the end. That's what actually punches the holes in the paper. It's got a nice slot for the paper to sit in there nicely and be aligned properly. The object is just used to punch holes in the paper."
tulip008,handmixer,1,"The object typically looks like one big rectangle with a, a handle on it. And it’s got rods that come down, I don’t know what the proper term is. But it’s got rods that come down, and then it’s got whisks and you use that to mix whatever you’re putting in the mixer. The object works by taking those whisks and spinning really fast, and it’s air bubbles in your mixture and it mixes all the ingredients together. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
tulip008,handmixer,2,". . Um so with the hand mixer, it’s got a handle on it, and you rotate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the handle and that will turn a gear that's connected to those whisks and so the faster you turn the handle the faster the whisks will turn. This is going to go handle at the top for you to to fix it against something so that you're able to hold it in a proper position. You just mix things with it. The object typically looks like a piece of metal with handles on it and whisks at the end. It's also got a plastic gear and plastic handle. The object works by putting it in a mixture and mixing things."
tulip008,shoehorn,1,"The object typically looks like some sheet metal or a thin piece of plastic with a handle on one end and a flared end at the other end so that it contours nicely to the heel of your foot and the heel of your shoe. The object works by prying the heel of your shoe open so that you can slide the heel of your foot in."
tulip008,shoehorn,2,"So this one was a piece of sheet metal. It's got one hole in it at the top so that you can hang it on something. Okay. It's bent in the middle so that it contours nicely to the inside of the heel of your shoe and it also contours to your foot. The object typically looks like a thin piece of metal or plastic and it's got a bend in it and that's about it. The object just works by prying open your shoe so that you're able to slide your foot in."
tulip008,bulbplanter,1,"This object… I'm not sure how this works.  I know this object is used to plant bulbs, which are, I think they’re perennials?  And so, they'll die over the winter but they'll come back during the spring and summer."
tulip008,bulbplanter,2,"The object is made out of thin sheet metal that's bent into a sphere and it's got a handle at the top made out of plastic.  The bottom end of the planter has grooves in it, which help cut through the dirt and The inside surface in there will allow all the dirt to collect and you'll be able to take it out of there much easier.  So, it's going to have markings on the side to help you figure out your depth of how deep you want your bulb to go. The object works by placing it in the ground and twisting and applying force. And that cuts up the dirt and you're able to take it out much easier."
tulip008,floppydisk,1,"This object is a piece of cardboard with I believe it’s something shiny or something with markings on it on the top surface. Cardboard and then some sort of plastic or metal. . The object just works by storing data and then transferring it."
tulip008,floppydisk,2,"The object is black and very thin. It's made of plastic. It's got metal bits on the front and the bottom. The bottom circle is made out of metal. The object just works by putting it into a port on a computer and transferring data."
tulip008,pocketradio,1,"This object is made out of plastic and it has an antenna on it. It will also have sliders that will let you tune the volume and tune the frequency of the channel that you want to tap into. It should also have sliders for AM and FM radio. The object works by using the antenna to tap into different AM and FM frequencies. It will amplify those frequencies and play them using your speaker."
tulip008,pocketradio,2,"The object is a rectangle with speaker holes on it. It has dials and sliders on the side to adjust the volume and tune the frequency. It has a long extendable rod. That is the antenna. It has screw holes on the back. And a slider that will show you exactly what volume you’re using and what frequency you’re on  The object works by tapping into AM and FM frequencies, amplifying them and then playing them using the speaker."
tulip008,crankflashlight,1,"This object typically looks like a bulb, a light bulb on one end and a handle at the other. Somewhere in the middle should be a handle that you turn and a gear connected to that internally that will transfer the energy from the crank rotation into electrical energy which will power the light bulb. The object works by cranking the crank which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy which powers the light bulb."
tulip008,crankflashlight,2,"The object is green and round. It has a clip on one end that will clip to a keychain or something else. It's got an on switch. It has a handle at the side that will nicely tuck into the device. It's got LED bulbs at the other end. The object works by turning the crank which powers the light bulb. It also has a solar panel on the side which takes energy from the sun and uses that to power the light."
tulip008,rolodex,1,"I'm not sure what it looks like or what it's made of. I'm also not sure what it's used for and how it works."
tulip008,rolodex,2,"The object is made of metal on the bottom. And... It's got plastic wheels and it also has paper just to write your contacts on. The object works by writing your contacts on pieces of paper so that you can organize them properly and the wheels will rotate the sections with each letter of the name of the contact that you have to bring it up to you so that you can open it and view properly."
tulip009,rolodex,1," Um, I haven't heard of this object before. I'm not really sure. Rolodex. The first thing that came to mind was like Rolex because it's a similar word.  Um, but I don't know. Maybe it's like a game of some sorts or something. Or something you can use in a game.  Um, I imagine Rolodex is like, yeah, like I said, like maybe something you can use in a game or some kind of like card playing game. But I'm not sure. I haven't heard of this."
tulip009,rolodex,2," The object is made out of plastic, like hard plastic on the outside.  And it's spinning like a wheel, it can spin like a wheel. And it has plastic cards that I assume you can write on. It looks like a mini file folder just like on rotation. I'm assuming that this object is used for like... maybe like studying index cards or writing stuff down and having it alphabetized. It's like a little mini file system. So I assume that's what it is. It's not like a flash card thing of some sort."
tulip009,shoehorn,1," A shoehorn is, it's usually made out of wood or sometimes it can be like plastic and I think it's like almost like a stretcher that you put into  A shoe, I'm thinking like more so like heels that like need to be like stretched out more like or any leather shoes to either keep them in place or to help with like making them comfortable and stretching them out and I've seen them in like wood or plastic variations. So a shoehorn is basically insert it into a shoe. And Some of them are like adjustable so you can like turn the knob depending on like if you want to make it like more narrower or bigger depending on like the shoe if you need to have it stretched out.  And I've seen people use them, like I said, like in like heels and stuff like that for just like making them more comfortable and stretching the leather out."
tulip009,shoehorn,2,"So it is made out of metal. And I have actually seen one of these before, I was getting it confused like another little shoe device but it is yeah metal and it helps with like putting your shoes on or getting shoes out is how I saw someone use at a store one time it was like to help put like a shoe like to take a shoe off is what I saw the lady use it as so I think how I saw is you take the shoe horn and you slip it between the like the heel part of your shoe in order to get your foot out on maybe like a tighter shoe and so it's easier to like put shoes on and off or I assume mostly Off instead of on"
tulip009,handmixer,1,"A device that makes it easier to mix things. Not like a full on like kitchen aid kind of mixer but it has a handle and the top part is usually made out of plastic or metal and it has like two whisks on either side and then it has like the on and off button and different speeds too so it's like a little handheld mixer. So you first have to insert like the metal whisks into like the hand mixer because they like are detachable from it and then you start grabbing it you just you press it on and then adjust the speed and then you'll turn you have to turn your hand too as you mix things."
tulip009,handmixer,2,"So this object does have two whisks two metal whisks and it is still made out of metal and plastic. Yeah it has like a handle on top and a little turn thing on the side of it Which I haven't seen a hand mixer like this before so I had like another one in mind but it's still like the same concept we have to turn the hand wheel in order for the whisks to start mixing. So it is used for mixing different ingredients or whisking things together  at a more rapid rate than a normal whisk would and so you grab the object, or you grab the top handle of it and you just turn it on and then you start turning the turn wheel and then the whisk start moving themselves to make it faster."
tulip009,floppydisk,1," I haven't heard of the object floppy disk, but I'm assuming it's obviously circular. Because it's a disk and I want to say it's going to be made out of hard plastic is what  I can assume and it's more like bendable, like malleable. I think it will be some sort of game or like toy that kids play with where they can like bend.  In my head I'm envisioning more of like a frisbee disk, but softer."
tulip009,floppydisk,2,"So this is made out of hard plastic and metal I think.  And it looks like a square, like almost like a big, like a bigger version of like an SD chip.  And it's just like a black square and it has a small disk on the, small like metal disk on the back side of it.  This object you put into either some kind of like tech device, maybe like a camera or a laptop or something. I'm assuming it's like a memory storage. So it holds a bunch of information in it."
tulip009,bulbplanter,1,"I'm assuming if it is that top part of the metal thing then it works to hold the light  bulb to the actual, to hold the light bulb like in place and to be able to screw it on to places."
tulip009,bulbplanter,2," So it looks like a metal cylinder, it's like a metal hollow cylinder that has a rugged bottom edge and then it also has a handle that you can grab on top so it's gonna have like metal and plastic. And it has like measuring units on one side of it too. Still not sure what it is used for but it's some sort of measuring device or it counts something as like a measurement based on the measurements that are on the side of it.  And I assume you insert, you grab it by the handle and you insert it somewhere to measure something."
tulip009,crankflashlight,1," Crank flashlight, I think it looks like your typical flashlight.  It has obviously like the little bulb in the inside of it, but I'm assuming there's a handle of some sort that you actually have to crank it on.  And I'm assuming it could be made out of like metal or plastic, that outer casing of the flashlight.  If it is something where you actually have to like crank the flashlight on, I'm assuming you  will either rotate or instead of like pressing the on button, rotate something and the flashlight lights up. And obviously flashlight is used to help you find things in the dark or just a useful light source to have."
tulip009,crankflashlight,2,"so this is a smaller flashlight that can be attached it has like a carabiner thing like on like the end of it it's made out of plastic has a light bulb in it it also has a little solar panel so it's like solar paneled flashlight and it does have the metal the middle of the plastic little spinning wheel that can crank it on this is a useful like for when you are going camping or you need like a light source to have in a dark area um it is solar paneled it also has an on and off button and there is a little crank where you spin it but i'm not really sure what the purpose of the the spinning you know the crank is if it has an on and off button"
tulip009,stethoscope,1,"Stethoscope.  I want to say it's the thing that doctors wear around their necks that has, it's like a necklace cut and they plug it into their ears too so it looks like earbuds.  And it's like a longer side on like, longer side at the end of it where it has a metal portion and yeah it looks like your stereotypical doctor's stethoscope. It is used to check heartbeat in patients. That's what doctors use it for. So they put it into their ears. Not exactly sure how it works but I do know they like put it into their ears and then the metal portion goes on the patient's chest and then they have them breathe in and out and then they can hear the heartbeat I think."
tulip009,stethoscope,2," So yeah, this object looks like a pair of earphones from the top and has a longer rubber-y handle that drips down.  And it has...it's made out of like rubber, plastic, and metal.  Yeah, I think that's it. So this object works by first putting the earpieces into your ear and then placing the circular metal part against someone's chest and it checks their heartbeat. And doctors commonly use it to check patients' heartbeats and they can hear their heartbeat through that."
tulip009,frenchpress,1,"A French press.  I've heard of it, and I know it's, I want to say some kind of kitchen utensil.  I think, I want to say it's like a coffee thing.  But, I'm assuming it's made out of like stainless steel or metal, if it's a kitchen utensil.  And maybe it has some plastic pieces in there, but I think it's mostly stainless steel and metal.  And, yeah, I'm not sure what it would look like.  I think it's like a coffee thing, where it's like the little... handle that they use when making an espresso shot. To like press down like the grounds of the coffee.  But, it almost looks like a little measuring cup. If it is that.  But I'm not too sure, so I know it's some kind of kitchen or coffee making utensil."
tulip009,frenchpress,2,"so this object looks like a small pitcher it has a plastic handle and a plastic lid on top it also has like metal little strainer slash swifter i don't know what that thing is called but and yeah it's composed of like either stainless steel or metal and plastic too and it looks like a little pitcher where you can pour things out i think it is used for coffee i think you put the coffee grounds at the bottom and using the sifter you press it down with i'm assuming water and so it only collects the liquid that comes out of the coffee grounds and then you can pour that into your coffee drink"
tulip009,fishingreel,1,"A fishing reel is... I'm assuming the long portion of a fishing rod.  So it's typically made out of plastic, I think?  Or maybe metal, and it's like a long piece and it has the fishing string going through it, too. So it's used for fishing. And... It... It's like the...  It passes through the fishing rod and the string does, and so that way it can catch the fish and you can reel it back in that way."
tulip009,fishingreel,2,"So this object is the bottom portion of the fishing rod.  It is metal and it has a turn handle and it has the string at the very top of it, the  fishing string that you use on your actual fishing rod, and it has a smaller handle at the bottom of it that you can either place somewhere or you can hold it better. So this object is used for fishing and you grab it.  Once it's attached to the actual fishing rod, the string goes through it and you grab the bottom of it and you crank it in order to reel a fish back in.  And I'm not sure about how, but I know you can reel it back inwards towards you."
tulip009,threeholepunch,1," So this object, three hole punch, it looks like, so it's like a long metal piece usually. Like I remember like the ones we used to have in like our elementary school classrooms. It was like a long metal piece and it was rectangular and it had like two sides and there on one side was the actual hole punching side. So you had like the three holes that would line up to a standard like printer piece of paper and then you'd press down on the opposite side and it would hole punch the paper and then there was like a little tray underneath where it collected all the pieces and you had to empty it out. So this object is used for hole punching paper to make it easier to put into like binders  or like some kind of like, yeah, mostly like binders or like filing systems that like require  binders, but you basically push the piece down and it hole punches, push the opposite piece down and it hole punches the sides."
tulip009,threeholepunch,2,"So this object is  This is a long, skinny, rectangular piece of metal. It has two portions. The bottom part that collects the little excess pieces of paper. And then it has the top part and there's springs that connect it on one side.  And when you press down on it, that's when the paper cuts on the opposite side. So this object is used for hole punching standard pieces of like printer paper. And you use it by pressing down on one side so that way the sharp end actually cuts through the paper."
tulip009,pocketradio,1," A pocket radio, what I'm picturing is like those walkie-talkie kind of radios, and it's gonna be made out of like plastic and look and have different buttons on it with probably like antenna rods sticking out of it and it's gonna be small enough to fit inside your pocket.  So this object works, I think the antenna gets like signal and that's how it's able to communicate  between like certain like distances from like satellites, but  I, if it's a pocket radio I'm assuming it's to speak to other people or maybe listen to music, um but I'm picturing more like walkie-talkies like you press down you can like communicate with other people via like a radio if you're on like the same like radio channel."
tulip009,pocketradio,2,"So this object is a small rectangular piece. It's made out of plastic and has an antenna sticking out. It also has a small like wristlet attached to like the side of it like yarn or string wristlet and it has numbers of like the AM and FM like radio stations and also has like a small speaker at the bottom of it and then it has dials on the side to either tune or also to adjust the volume too and just has a little switch for AM and FM. So this object works by assuming you turn it on and then you can listen to your favorite music it's like a portable like a portable radio where you can like tune into like a radio channel and you can like adjust the volume with it and you can also tune it too so I think this has a scale portion at the top which I think is to flip through channels"
tulip010,pocketradio,1," Um, this object typically looks relatively smaller, has like a mesh over the speaker, typically has like a handle to hold it or an antenna as well. Made of all kinds of different metals and some plastic for like knobs and buttons.  Um, object works by receiving like FM or AM radio waves to then output whatever source it's receiving,  whether it's music or, um, I keep doing it on the wrong side.  Um, it's, yeah, used for receiving input.  But from radio waves, whether FM, AM, um, and typically, yeah, just plays music or any kind of radio station.  Yeah, that's about it."
tulip010,pocketradio,2," Um, definitely smaller than initially interpreted.  Uh, it looks like a, almost like a bigger Nokia phone like in size at least.  Uh, I was expecting to see like two like meshed areas in front of the speaker is definitely one smaller. Does still have an antenna. Has a little volume button on the side of it and a little hand wrist thing to put over your wrist to hold it so it doesn't fall or break.  Yeah, used by, or, it's used by receiving FM and AM radio waves and used to play like music or listen to radio stations. That's about it."
tulip010,fishingreel,1," So fishing reel typically looks like a circular,  yeah, like a cylinder-like object with almost like a cone at bottom. piece to like feed fishing line. It has like a handle to like reel in the line too when a fish is caught.  And then I know they have like a, almost like a little metal wire as a guard that you kind of flip up and down. And that's about it about how it looks and.  Okay, I kind of did this part already, but it's used for feeding and holding fish. fishing line and then reeling it in for when a fish has been caught or just the line needs to be brought in obviously used for fishing"
tulip010,fishingreel,2,"down to a bit of a not a point but like kind of comes down to a cone shape to a like a handle that kind of attaches to the rod itself yeah and then other parts fishing line or like hold connecting to the rod to the fishing line can be fed through the spindle and then up through the loops of the fishing rod to then attach a any kind of like hook or jig or whatever object you're using on the fishing reel or a fishing line and it's used for fishing"
tulip010,crankflashlight,1," Okay, so they look like a typical flashlight.  Sometimes they look like a typical flashlight, like cylinder in nature. Sometimes they look like a little box shaped.  They tend to have, well not tend, they do have a little, whatchamacallit, like a little handle to like twist and rotate so that you can increase like the kinetic energy in there to get the flashlight to function.  So it works by just pulling the, taking out the handle and rotating it around for the kinetic energy to build up so that you can then utilize the bulb inside to emit some light. And it doesn't require any batteries."
tulip010,crankflashlight,2," Okay, so it typically looks like, kind of like a typical flashlight with a handle to rotate around. It has a bulb, a little   like synthetic plastic cover on top of the bulbs to protect them and is made of plastic.  Except for the, I would assume glass for the bulb itself. It's used by cranking the handle to build up kinetic energy and it seems like on that  last, on the one I looked at had a solar panel to also help store some of that extra energy to then use the light to like see in the dark."
tulip010,frenchpress,1," French press looks, well it's made of typically like glass but like rubber handle, like plastic rubber handle. And also has a  It has like a, almost like a siphoning type of thing that goes on top and like a little metal rod that goes through that so you can push and press down coffee.  It's used for making coffee, making tea sometimes.  It's used by putting tea leaves or coffee grounds in the bottom and putting in, typically  from my experience, would be like cooler water and then you kind of just keep pressing and siphoning the grounds and the tea leaves through the water and then let it soak up and concentrate over time."
tulip010,frenchpress,2," Okay, so it looks typically cylinder in nature with a little, at the very top, a little spout piece that kind of converges into a point so you can pour like that evenly.  It has a handle made out of plastic, some metal, glass.  It's two different pieces that are together, like put together. And then the other piece is like a metal coiled piece that you use to siphon through and like sift all of the whatever's in the water with it.  And it has like a long metal pole with a little ball, like a plastic ball bearing on top to like pump the mesh. Siphon.  Yeah, I kind of just described part of how it functions.  It's used to like, the top part is used to pump and push the grounds and the water together  and siphon out, siphon through and help the concentration of the tea or coffee. And it's used to make tea or coffee."
tulip010,threeholepunch,1,"Okay, 3 hole punch is typically made out of metal almost entirely except for like a rubber bottom to stabilize it from sliding anywhere. And it looks rectangular in shape with a long slightly angled handle you press down and that has like 3 metal I guess little plungers I'm just got primed for that word but little spokes almost that help to push through paper. So it works by pressing on the slightly angled handle or lever to then push the 3 plungers in and create little holes in paper even evenly distributed holes in paper to then put the paper in like a binder."
tulip010,threeholepunch,2," A rectangular shaped handle on top with a little bit of a Crescent shape on it as well, at a bit of an angle to like put some force on and yes, it was made out of metal. It works by pushing the lever on top to then put some pressure onto the coil, onto the springs, and then push the plungers through into paper, typically paper at least.  Um, and yeah, used to put holes in paper and then put that paper into a binder."
tulip010,floppydisk,1,"This is more speculation because I'm not sure.  Um, I'm assuming it's like a non-burnt CD that's like empty, that doesn't have anything on it yet.  Um, made out of different kinds of metal and cylinder in nature. Kind of circular. And very thin.  Um, it's used, what my previous knowledge was right, that it's used for putting into a computer or some kind of hard drive to then like burn information or films or music of any kind onto the disk."
tulip010,floppydisk,2,"Okay so it’s made primarily of plastic with a little few pieces of metal in there it's square shaped and yeah okay um it's it's used in computers um it looked i believe it's used as some kind of like ram or like information storing device for a computer um yeah that's about all i got"
tulip010,shoehorn,1,"i've got two things that i'm thinking of for this one but it can look like one of either two ways either like a almost like a banana-like shape that's like very thin and flat and made of plastic or almost like a metal like triangular shape that you put on like more like cowboy boots type of thing um okay so how it works is you if it's the previous like the initial one that i described it's you put the you put it into the heel of the shoe and you slide your foot into it or if it's the latter of the two um you kick your heel back onto it and lift your feet take your feet out of the boot it's used to just put either shoes On or off"
tulip010,shoehorn,2,"okay so a somewhat similar banana shape with a bit of like a ovaling type of shape to it at the point so it's not sharp it's made of metal at least the one that i saw it can come in either plastic or metal works by putting your basically putting your shoes on you put the the round more obtuse side of it into the heel of the shoe and then push it back and then you just slide your feet in and then kick your your heel down and it just slides it right in instead of breaking the back end of the shoe"
tulip010,handmixer,1,"typically made of metal I'm thinking like a whisk that you'd use like beat eggs or flour but some metal handle cylinder metal handle and then a bunch of like metal wire that's kind of being looped around into a bunch of like into like a almost like an egg shape with a head of it used for baking cooking whisking eggs"
tulip010,handmixer,2,"okay so primarily made out of metal and then I'm thinking like a plastic or rubber handle it looks it's more complex in shape it has the handle top with a like a rotating disc that helps to then be rotated by the handle on the side to then rotate the whisking pieces that are looped pieces of metal to mix up everything it's used in primarily in cooking I don't know what else could be really used for yeah cooking we wrote you rotate the handle to the whisk and then mix things it's typically for like baking"
tulip010,rolodex,1,"okay so typically the main component of is plastic typically sometimes they're made out of metal kind of rare though my knowledge it has uh usually like a circular handle on one of the usually like a circular handle on one of the sides and I mean usually if they're working or being used they have paper in them as well. They tend to have a plastic cover that goes over them as well. It looks almost dome shaped. It works by holding slips of paper to store note cards or phone  numbers of individuals, typically phone numbers. Basically like a yellow book, predated yellow books I guess that you'd keep on a desk. You rotate the little handle on the side and it just flips through all of the pieces of paper in there."
tulip010,rolodex,2," So it's typically made of plastic, some metals, and then also paper. It's round I guess with stands.  Yeah, I'll go with that.  It functions just by rotating the handles on the side to then flip through sometimes just note cards or from the one I looked at, alphabetized.  It's used to store any kind of information, whether it's phone numbers or it could even be used as like a"
tulip010,bloodpressurecuff,1,"Okay. Okay.  Typically made of, I don't know what the actual cuff itself is made of, but t And then there's a like a bit of a Velcro piece to it. And then like a book like a rubber balloon inside the whatever the fabric is encasing it. And then attached to like a cylinder rubber tube or plastic tube and then connected to that the other end is a rubber like air pressure compressor. Manual one. And then you get to a certain threshold of air in the little ballooning cuff and slowly lower it to see somebody's blood pressure and read it's usually used on doctor's offices."
tulip010,bloodpressurecuff,2,"Okay, typically made out of some kind of fabric on the actual cuff itself with like a balloon inside of that connected to a cylinder rubber or plastic tube and it kind of splits into two pieces one with like a gauge to yeah one with a gauge on it with numbers and then the other end of it else has like a rubber manual pump and that cylinder and circular egg-shaped works by pumping the rubber pump and then the balloon inside the cuff itself inflates and as you slowly decrease the pressure from that the gauge registers just how much pressure is being used and it gauges somebody's blood pressure used it's used in doctors offices"
tulip010,stethoscope,1,"It's made out of metal and rubber or plastic tubing. Tubing comes like fans out into a triangle shape with almost like ear plugs on one end and on the other end it has a metal microphone amplifier. It's like a microphone. It's got some sounds. I don't know how to describe the other end piece. It works by putting the ear plug pieces into a doctor's ear and then a doctor will then  take the amplifying microphone, the metal piece, and put it on somebody's back or chest to then check somebody's heart rate to see if there's any irregularities or not."
tulip010,stethoscope,2,"So typically made out of like rubber or plastic tubing and then metal parts as well.  The part that kind of diverges into a triangular, almost shape, and then has earpieces on the  end, that part's typically made out of metal. and the other end of the tube falls into a circular metal microphone or sound amplifier.  It's used in medical offices, I would assume also probably in an ambulance, and it's used to just gauge and hear somebody's heartbeat to determine if they're normal or irregular."
tulip010,bulbplanter,1,"I honestly have no idea what... I'm just going to interpret it  Based off of the wording itself, bulb, I'm going to assume it has its circular nature. Um... Bulb planter.  Made out of glass, and that's all I can really think of. I have no idea its function or what it's used for. I'm going to just guess. Bulb planter. Um... Okay.  Based off of what I'm reading, I'm just going to assume either something that helps plant  plants, or something that holds or puts in light bulbs."
tulip010,bulbplanter,2," Okay, so typically made out of plastic, it's cylinder in nature with a bottom that's hollow,  um, and comes up into a plastic, uh, handle.  So this object works by, um, plunging it into the, into the dirt, and then lifting it,  er, pressing the little handle so that the spokes open, like, so that, yeah, the spokes  kind of like slide in and out a little bit, just depending on the handle pressure that you put onto it on the side.  Uh, plunge it, and then you release the handle so that it kind of captures and scoops just a little bit of the dirt.  And then you lift it out, and you can use that for planting, you can use it for, uh,  moving, uh, the whole, uh, golf course at the end of the putting green."
tulip011,bulbplanter,1," I am not sure what a bulb planter is, but I would say it's like the bulb that emits light.  My guess is that it emits light, but I don't know really how it works."
tulip011,bulbplanter,2,"This object looks like a metal circle with a handle. And it has some lines to measure.  Centimeters, I believe. I would say it works to measure. I'm not sure what."
tulip011,pocketradio,1,"I think this object typically looks like a little square that emits sound with like a little screen where you can see some numbers. So I'm going to try to get some numbers. I think it works by emitting sounds like music."
tulip011,pocketradio,2,"The pocket radio looks like a little square, kind of like metally-colored with some buttons on the side, and then it has like an antenna and you can adjust the channels of the radio with the buttons on the side. It is used for transmitting radio channels and it will like transmit sounds."
tulip011,handmixer,1,"I think a hand mixer looks like a metal kind of like straws with like a handle so you can mix stuff up I think it would be used for like cooking or when you're like making a cake or something"
tulip011,handmixer,2,"this object typically looks like metals strings with like a handle and it's to mix up stuff it works to mix maybe like batter or it's used for cooking and it works by you can either do it by hand or move the lever in the handle so you can mix up everything"
tulip011,rolodex,1,"I am not sure of what a rolodex is I would guess it's made out of metal  How this object works and what it's used for, I would say it's something that rolls just because of the word."
tulip011,rolodex,2,"How a Rolodex looks would be like a metal base with some kind of like handles on the Side so you can Rotate them and change the papers by alphabetical order. How this object works would be by turning the levers on the side and finding the letter  you're looking for with the information, I would say, sorted in alphabetical order."
tulip011,threeholepunch,1,"A three hole punch is like a metal they kind of look like scissors like two metal handles with some with three holes that puncture like a sheet of paper so I can make holes how this object works you would like press the handles and it would make a hole in a sheet of paper and it's you well it would make three holes in a sheet of paper and it would be used to like maybe put like a sheet of paper in a binder"
tulip011,threeholepunch,2,"this object looks like a elongated shape of metal that you have to press in order to make three holes in a sheet of paper how this object works is you put this sheet of paper in between other the levers the metal levers and you press on them and that's how you would get the holes"
tulip011,fishingreel,1,"I think a fishing reel looks like a metal square kinda with a little wheel like on the side and a handle. So you can hold the handle and kinda like roll it around to bring the strength that you fish with.  How this object works, you place your hand on the handle and then you roll it back or forth depending on where you want  the string, I can't remember how it's called, with the one you fish."
tulip011,fishingreel,2,"This object typically looks like a metal piece that has a handle and it has like a wheel system going on at the front part which that's like the cord or the string you fish with. It's either like loose or tightened up. This object is used for fishing and it would work by turning the handle to the front or to the back."
tulip011,crankflashlight,1,"A crank flashlight.  It's like a plastic object that emits light, but in order to do so, you have to, there's like a lever or like a handle on the side that you have to roll. This object would work to emit light and use for like when you go camping in the dark."
tulip011,crankflashlight,2,"This object typically looks like a plastic kind of like an elongated shape with some clear space on the top where the light would come out from. It has a lever with like a little handle on the side so you can charge it. This object works for emitting light especially like in the dark and it is used for just like as a light."
tulip011,stethoscope,1,"The stethoscope usually looks like two metal bars that connect to a longer one. It has a circle shaped metal at the end. This object is used in the medical field to hear the heartbeats. It would be used by placing it above the chest of the person and then the doctor puts the other ends on their ears to hear the heartbeats."
tulip011,stethoscope,2,"This object looks like two metal pieces that connect to your ears. And it has like a longer part at the bottom that's made of plastic that connects to a circular shape of metal at the end.  This object is used in the medical field, especially with like doctors, to check up your heartbeat.  And it works by putting the metal parts, the longer metal parts that are connected to your ears for the doctor and then he places the circular metal part on your chest to hear your heartbeat."
tulip011,floppydisk,1," I'm not sure about how this object looks like, but because of the name I would say it's like a round disc shape.  I'm not sure what it's used for, but I would say... I'm not sure."

tulip011,shoehorn,1," I'm not sure what a shoehorn is, but I would say it looks like  I don't know, it says horn, so I would say it's like a curve shape.  I'd say it's something for like the feet maybe, because it says shoe."
tulip011,shoehorn,2," This object looks like a kind of like a stick, a metal stick. I think this object works for like a inserting your shoes easily if I'm correct. And the way it works is you put  the metal stick like on your heel, between your heel and the shoe, to make it easier for you to put your shoes on."
tulip011,frenchpress,1,"A french press usually looks like a clear glass cylinder with a handle on top and it has like a metal circular thing inside which is for making your coffee. It's used for making coffee and it would work by putting the coffee grains and then I can't remember if you push it up or I mean you push it down or pull it up in order to make the coffee."
tulip011,frenchpress,2,"This object typically looks like a glass cylinder with kind of like a handle or like a lever on top that moves a circular metal part inside that act like filters.

tulip012,fishingreel,1," It tends to be long with an attached, it tends to be a rod with attached fishing line on  it and it's got a, it's like a pulley system where you put it in and out or like you reel it to either take fish out of the water or put the reel in. So it was what it's typically used for.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, and it'll be made from like metal fishing reel, like a fishing line and yeah. I think it's.  It has a system where you can, I don't know if you can see it, but it has a system where It's a system where you can. Where you can put the fishing line in or out of the water depending on how you use the handle and it's typically used for fishing. You attach a hook to the end of it and bait and you can fish that way. Okay."
tulip012,fishingreel,2,"It seems like the fishing reel does not include the rod, like I was wrong in that sense. But um it works with the um with putting the handle either clockwise or counter clock wise which will reel in presumable the attached fishing line, well that’s not actually in this example, but works slightly differently to what I thought, but yeah. It typically looks like a handle attached to a cylinder which I assume has cogs and mechanisms inside it to function. Um, it’s made of metal, plastic, it’s got fishing line on it um. Yeah and by spinning the handle it moves the line either one way to another and it’s used for fishing. You attach the hook and bait and try and reel fish in that way"
tulip012,threeholepunch,1,"I assume it's the hole punch where... It'll be made of metal in kind of like a sideways V shape.  And then on the bottom, it'll have a plastic covering where... The paper that's been punched goes into and you can empty it. And it's typically made from... I think I already said that. Metal. And... Yeah. It punches...  It has kind of a template with a sort of perforating function where if you press down on top of the punch, it can go through the paper. And it's used for... Or punching holes through paper so that it can be like filed away or attached to other things."
tulip012,threeholepunch,2,"The object looks... It looks exactly how I thought it would. But it's in kind of a shape of a sideways V. And it's got the attached... Kind of plastic bottom. And it's got spring mechanisms in it. Um... And it's made from metal with a bit of plastic on the bottom. And it works to punch holes through paper. And that is to be able to file them away or attach them to other bits. It'd be things such as like manuscripts and research papers and whatnot."
tulip012,frenchpress,1,"I don’t actually know  what a French press is I assume it's something to do with coffee but I don’t really know I've no clue how it looks I don't know what it's made from and I"
tulip012,frenchpress,2,"so it looks like a jug or a cylinder with an attached spout which we made from glass and then it has the has a plastic handle plastic lid and a filter on the inside that can be lifted and put down by moving the top of the handle and it seems to have metal placing around it and it works by I assume inserting coffee of some sort and pressing down the filter to make sure the grounds don't get into the liquid I think"
tulip012,rolodex,1,"I don't know what a rolodex is  either so I could not tell you how it looks or what it's made from I don’t know how it works and what it's used for"
tulip012,rolodex,2,"um it looks like it's kind of hard to describe it's made of metal plastic with attached paper on kind of a spiral that works around a pivot of some sort and it looks like there's one band of metal going around to kind of hold it down and it works by rotating the side rotating the plastic handles on the side and it rotates the paper which are labelled with different letters of the alphabet around the middle metal bit I have a feeling it's used for categorising certain information possibly names phone numbers addresses so it kind of works like an address book"
tulip012,crankflashlight,1," The crank flashlight is, I'm assuming smaller torches that you get where you move a lever  around a, move a lever around a centre and it kind of generates kinetic energy which keeps the light  going. I think it's made from like plastic, metal, an LED bulb and so on. And it works by cranking the lever around and this generates the energy to keep the LED bulb going and I think it's used for  well it's used for light but it's not, you can't just turn on and off the switch, it's actually you have to have the continuous motion to do it."
tulip012,crankflashlight,2," So, this one here is a Um this one is army green, I think it’s tactical equipment of some sort. There's a switch to turn the light on and the  crank on the side. It's made from plastic, this one has a solar panel, LED bulbs, screws and so on. And this one doesn't seem to work by cranking the lever but it  has an on and off switch and it's used for, it uses a light source."
tulip012,handmixer,1," I think a hand mixer, looks like a whisk but it's got sort of a motor on top which you can...  Which you can press an on button to make it whisk and it's made from metal, plastic.  Yeah. And it works by either turning, either turning it on and off or if it's the mechanical  one doing the lever and it's used for, to make it easier to whisk things such as eggs, mixed smoothies and other foods that need to be mixed like that."
tulip012,handmixer,2," Um, it looks like a regular whisk, a regular metal whisk. Um, however it has a plastic addition to it which is a cog that gets turned by a lever which moves the whisks on the bottom and it's topped with plastic. the lever and which moves the whisk on the bottom and it's used for beating eggs or mixing things together so it doesn't require as much power as it would by hand mixing it."
tulip012,pocketradio,1,"So pocket radio looks just like a very small radio I'm assuming where it has a speaker and antenna  and dials to tune into certain frequencies. I assume it's made from like metal, plastic and so on. It works by tuning into certain frequencies which are emitted by radio towers and I guess it's used  for, oh and it's battery powered and it's used for being able to listen to the radio when you haven't got one in let's say a car or a larger one that you can plug into anywhere. the blood pressure cuff looks like an armband um and it has an attached uh  not a wire, it has an attached tube to it where you pump air into it and it tightens on someone's bicep to be able to take their blood pressure and it will be made from  fabric, velcro plastic and it works by increasing the air pressure by pumping on the balloon attached to it or the pump attached to it and it increases the pressure around your arm making it very very tight and making it easy easier to measure to measure blood pressure um I think it has an attached dial on it too"
tulip012,pocketradio,2,"It's seems to be made of plastic with a metal antenna and on the back it's got switches  for tuning to FM or AM radio, volume switch, on off dial, headphone jack and yeah. It works by tuning into FM or AM frequencies and being able to listen to it on the go because it  only requires batteries, it doesn't need to be plugged into mains."
tulip012,bloodpressurecuff,1,""
tulip012,bloodpressurecuff,2," It's made from fabric, plastic, rubber and there's a dial to measure pressure. It works by pumping air into the armband which increases the pressure around your arm. I'm not entirely sure how it measures the pressure but it seems that when I press the air out of the armband the pressure dial goes up. So I'm not entirely sure how that works."
tulip012,stethoscope,1,"um stethoscope has earpieces it looks like a pair of headphones it has earpieces that connect into a tube and a metal end and it will be made from rubber and metal and it works by magnifying the sound of a patient's heartbeat  and it's used for detecting heartbeat, heart murmurs and what not in patients by doctors"
tulip012,stethoscope,2,"Uh it has metal rods attached to an ear piece that connect into one rubber tube that’s attached to a metal circle which has some sort of plastic covering on it which probably conducts some sound and the sound travels up through the tube and into the ear pieces. And it’s pressed against the patient’s heart beat. It’s used to detect heart beat and heart murmurs and I think also breathing sounds to make sure that a patient is healthy."
tulip012,floppydisk,1,"Uh floppy disk is a small plastic disk with kind of a white detailing on it that has like this save button on a word document. And I think it’s made from plastic and has other internal mechanisms. And I think it was one of the first um sources for storage with computers and it isn’t really used any more but it was used as a hard drive."
tulip012,floppydisk,2,"um it's a black plastic square with metal detailing on it and a metal circular disc on the other side of it but again it's used for storage this is 1.44 megabytes so it's very old it doesn't store that much now comparatively but at the time it was used as a hard drive"
tulip012,bulbplanter,1,"um I don't really know what a bulb planter is I'm assuming something to do with gardening um and I'm guessing that it's used to plant bulbs in a garden"
tulip012,bulbplanter,2,"um it looks like a hollow cylinder with no top or bottom made out of metal with a a black plastic handle on top which you can squeeze in and out to either increase or decrease the volume of the cylinder um and it works by the I think by the bottom being jagged it can easily insert into soil and I think you hold the handles together to insert into the soil um and then Something like that and then you take out the soil plant the bulb and then you can drop the soil over it I guess to make sure that the bulb is well planted"
tulip012,shoehorn,1,"shoehorn probably made of plastic or probably made of plastic or metal and it looks like just very long rod of some sort which is curved slightly and it's often it's used for helping to take off shoes without having to bend down or have someone else take them off for you so it'll be like boots and whatnot"
tulip012,shoehorn,2,"so the shoehorn will be this one is made of metal and it's a bit shorter than I was expecting but I assume it's also in case you have dirty shoes and you don't want to touch the outside of them and to take them off and yes it’s used to take off your shoes"
tulip013,floppydisk,1," Floppy disk is typically made out by plastic and disk inside, like a CD record inside.  And I think there's like, how do we say, kind of like shifting bar to like let it read or  not, I believe.  And yeah, you can really  Think of the USB and the, yeah, USB and kind of like old version of the CD.  So, this floppy disk is out having like two major components, I will say. Mainly,  It's wrapped with the plastic. Some of them might be clear and colorful. And the inside is made up with a CD-shaped disk to read the data inside. And the purpose of the floppy disk is storing the data and transport it."
tulip013,floppydisk,2,"of shaped plastic I believe it's made out of so the outside on the outer layer there's the plastic covering and protecting the CD which hold the data inside and there's like the metal made shift bar I'm assuming that's used to used when you insert that into computer or something to read So floppy disks can be used by inserting into computer or a specific machine to read the floppy disk and I believe when you put it into the computer you have to just slide the top metal portion or it might be plastic but slide it and insert it to lock the floppy disk and read the data and the purpose of floppy disk again is to store the data and to transport without carrying the computer back then because it was really heavy I mean computer used to be really heavy and floppy disk made it really portable the data itself portable"
tulip013,rolodex,1," Ah, Rolodex. I have no clue what this object is. Rolo? I'm assuming you can spin and play around as I say Rolo.  Yeah, I just... I genuinely have no clue what is this. Describe this object. What is it used for? I have no clue what is the purpose of this. I'm assuming it's toy."
tulip013,rolodex,2,"I think Rolodex looks like kind of like a bottom half of the S shape with the pipe going through and the disc to spin that pipe. On the pipe there's alphabetically separated cards and the papers and I think it is used to store people's name or maybe it could be used as a flashcard. I think Rolodex is doing a similar role as a flashcard like storing people's name or information in alphabetical order and you can write it down and you can spin so it's more easier to see it than the flashcard. I believe."
tulip013,bloodpressurecuff,1,"I think blood pressure cuff is made by some sort of a clothe and plastic how do we call it? Plastic plastic yeah I mean plastic kind of like a zipper plastic bond I will say. It's like hold the stuff together when you put them put them together. And there's I believe there's a tooth going in. Blood pressure cuff. Yeah some of the some of the I think most of them have a blood pressure cuff have a have a hole so the air pressure can air can be applied so the yeah I think that's the function. cuff can be used by applying air pressure into the cuff and the cuff itself. In the cuff there's like stretchable I believe it's balloon like rubber inside and outside is covered by the clothe so it can get restricted. So it won't explode. Blood pressure cuff is used to apply the pressure in your hand so they can read your blood pressure consistently."
tulip013,bloodpressurecuff,2,"has a a yeah. I think blood pressure cuff has a great pressure.  Blood pressure cuff is typically made out of like plastic, how do we say it? The plastic bag-ish cloth. And inside of that bag there's like a blue stretchable. Or maybe an actual plastic bag is inside of the plastic bag-ish cloth. And it holds the air so the band could be harder.  And there's a plastic zipper or a plastic bond, I'm not sure of the actual name, that holds the band together.  So you can put it on the hand as a, similar as a handcuff. But... And there is a tooth going inside of the bag.  And send the, there's one of the palms that you keep pressing to send the air inside. And there's another circular air pressure reader.  And when there's a pressure applied to the cuff and the airbag, like resistance from the bag, they will read that pressure. Based on how resistive it is. How the resistance... Oh this is so hard to explain. The... The... Yup. That's all I can say. Blood pressure cuff works by reading the resistance of... Of...  Of the air, I believe, from the hand.  Because you put it on the hand and when it is attached to the hand, the blood is pumping out. So it will push out. So maybe it's measuring that.  And it is used to measure the blood pressure, of course. Uh..."
tulip013,shoehorn,1,"I believe shoe horn is needle shaped horn with a hole. And I believe it's used to make a huge sound.  Maybe, yeah. Let's see how this object works. Shoe horn. Shoe horns are used to make really big sounds.  And just to answer the previous question about what it is made out of, I believe it's typically wood or the bone of animal."
tulip013,shoehorn,2,"Shoe horn look like an arch shape, and it’s like slightly bended There's like arch shape. Because. No we will not explain this. But it's arch shaped. Typically wood made. But for this one particularly. It's metal made. And there's an arch. And perpendicular shaped. But the corners are cut. Rounded. And. This object. Is used. For people to put the shoes on. Especially those for like suits. Or really tight shoes. Especially those need supports. And it can be used by. Putting into shoes first. And then you slowly put your. Legs inside of the shoes. And. It will assist. Your leg to be. Inserted into the shoes. Without hurting your finger. Instead of shoe horn. Or without breaking the. Back of the shoes."
tulip013,pocketradio,1," I think pocket radio have a square shape. Not square. Sometimes square, sometimes perpendicular. And it has a multiple hole to plug in your headphone or earpods back then. And there is a speaker.  And I think it's typically made out of the metal and the plastic, I believe. The pocket radio is used to listen to the radio.  And I am not sure how it works, but I know there is a tiny antenna that catch the radio's frequency."
tulip013,pocketradio,2,"Pocket radio typically is a boxed shape with a pencil shaped or maybe I should say cylinder shaped tube. That's used to... catch the radio sound.  It's typically made by metal for the antenna, the tube portion, and the box is typically made by plastic and yeah. So in the pocket radio there's a... Typically there's a... There's a unique way to tune their pocket radio frequency to catch the... The frequency of the radio sent out from the radio station. And... I forgot the word. And the pocket radio is used to listen to the radio portably. And it can carry some batteries. So people don't have to plug the radio into some charging board."
tulip013,bulbplanter,1,"bulb planter as the same planter we're using to insert the bulb into ceiling I believe or it might be pottery shaped I honestly am not sure in terms of bulb planter I think it's like a system tool to use to insert the bulb on the ceiling like a light bulb or maybe bulb planter is like bulb light bulb shaped planter to keep the vegetation in shape like a pottery I believe"
tulip013,bulbplanter,2,"handles growing on it and you can press and it's made out of the pottery shaped portion both planter can be used for replacing the vegetation on the growing in the nature wild Or probably in the backyard or maybe grass or normal flowers you can replace them with you can on the handle you can press it to expand a pottery portion a little bit bigger and you probably insert that on the ground and release the pressure on the handle and now the pottery portion which made out of the metal will compress so you can grasp on the soil and you pull it out and you put other vegetation inside with the same method so the purpose of a bowl planter is to replace the vegetation or the backyard flowers"
tulip013,handmixer,1,"hand mixer is like it's having the shape as the water drop with the handle growing on the tip of the water drop and the how do we say water dropped portion is made with a lot of the metal string that's following the pattern of the water draw blood like and it is some of them are made out of the metal and handle as well and some of them might be made by the rubber and plastic and they usually have the hook at the end of the handle so what in the hand mixer the water droplet shaped wire which are crossing in the center used to mix or flower the water typically used for the cooking purposes and it just makes food and everything easier to mix and you just grip on the handle and you just manually mix it"
tulip013,handmixer,2,"hand mixer typically look like a water droplet and with the handle growing on it with a gear in the middle to mix to to move the mixer and it is typically made out of metal plastic probably rubber as well so hand mixer work by spinning spinning the gear while holding the handle and when you spin the gear the mixers which is a water droplet shaped metal made mixing tool will start spinning one goes clockwise one goes counterclockwise so it can efficiently get mixed and it's typically used to mixing eggs or flour or sometime some soy sauce with some ingredients I believe and yeah it's usually used to mix everything together"
tulip013,crankflashlight,1,"I think crank flashlight is typically made out of the light bubble or LED light with a plastic like normal flashlight to do.  And I'm not sure what the crank flashlight is, but that's my best guess based on the flashlight portion.  You can convert electronic energy into the light by the battery, I believe. And it is used to light up stuff in emergency."
tulip013,crankflashlight,2,"A crank flashlight typically looks like a normal flashlight but they have unique characteristics as well. Same as the normal flashlight there’s a portion you can grip on and it spins with the handle. And it’s made out of LED light, probably glasses or plastic, and there’s a plastic. Oh there’s of course an on off button that you switch. This crank flashlight is used for emergency light up purposes. And there's a battery build inside to store the electricity. And you can make the electricity by spinning the handle.  Or for this particular example, it had a solar panel built in. so you can convert multiple energies into the light energies and this crank flashlight typically works by using that stored electricity into the light and that light can be turned off by on and off it will not be off yeah the light can be stored by the spinning the spinning the handle or the solar light and when you press the on and off button when you hit the on on the on and off button it will the light will turn on so it's not consistently on and your electricity can be stored and electricity I mean the light is expanded through the glass or plastic lens"
tulip013,fishingreel,1," Fishing reel look like, typically should look like,  how do we say it, two cylinder connected by the metal or plastic portion that holding together.  And the first portion is also carrying the string as well, wrapped around that cylinder.  And then there's a handle on the other cylinder that you can twist, you can spin, To roll the strings around another cylinder.  And it is typically made out of a string, usually metal and some might be plastic.  This fishing reel work by convert, yeah, it's like pulling the stuff, you spin and mechanical energy will be pulling your string to the other cylinder because when you pull when you spin that handle your another cylinder will start spinning to convert that energy and not converting it just rolls the strings in and it is used for fishing purposes usually or to roll the strings back when you release it to catch the fish"
tulip013,fishingreel,2,"Reel have a one cylinder on top of the airplane  tail, I will say. On top of the tail.  I mean, you could think of  yeah, yeah, yeah. You could think of the airplane tail attached to the cylinder with a handle on it. And it is typically made out of metal and plastic on some portion and a string wrapped around the cylinder and the cylinder can spin. This fishing reel Work by spinning the handle and when you spin the handle it will start spinning the cylinder and the cylinder  will go up and down, up and down. I have no clue why it's that going on. But cylinder will be contracting in the strings so you can get the fishes from deep ocean to nearby surface or where you are at. And there is a lock on the reel that suffices by the reel for going  for both direction, which means to release the string or to contract the string. So you can release the string to the ocean . And you can catch the fish. And there is another switch on the other side of that switch. You can stop and lock it in one direction. So I believe I used that switch to turn on and off if rotation of direction of the cylinder and when the... I will say it's probably lock.  And when the lock is on, the cylinder will only spin  into the one direction, which is contracting the string.  So I believe when you lock it, the reel will only... I believe that's the situation you use when you caught the fish and you just only want to pull the strings instead of letting it go. And it usually worked by spinning handle. I believe I said it."
tulip014,bulbplanter,1,"To the best of my imagination. It's a planter box. It's probably shaped in a bulb sense.  It's probably round, if I had to guess, and probably made of, like, a terracotta.  Given that it's a planter, it's probably used to raise small crops before they're transplanted to the ground.  So that, like... It can have a smaller isolated habitat."
tulip014,bulbplanter,2," Alright, this time I noticed that it is actually a metallic, almost like a digging sort of device. It's very round and at the bottom it's hollow. There's a hole and it's kind of serrated. There's some shaded bits around the edge.  There's also a handle at the top, so it would seem that it's used as a way to push into the ground. It's also got measurements on the side used to measure just how deep you're going.  It's round, like I had said, metallic, and it has the serrated bits at the bottom. I'd imagine that it's used to push into the ground at a certain distance. My best guess would be that it's round. It's used for planting crops or small vegetation."

It does this by compressing onto the selected area and I will be able to test the blood pressure that way."
tulip014,bloodpressurecuff,2,"Uh the blood pressure cuff is um made of a few different components. There’s a pressure gauge, just made of typical glass like or metal with the numbers inside and an arrow that would indicate the level it’s at. There’s also connected to that in the lining like a tube to the actual cuff that’s measuring, as well as there’s a rubber… I don’t know the exact term to use but a little balloon in your hand which you would use to increase the pressure to the cuff. Which is also connected with a little tube to the cuff and is made out of hollow plastic or other material. It has velcro, it is used to fashion it against a patient’s arm uh securely. And once you have it fashioned to the patient’s arm it is used to measure the patient’s blood pressure. This is done by squeezing the um the balloon like item and then you read the measurement on the gauge."

tulip014,pocketradio,1,"I'd imagine that the pocket radio  has a more square rectangular body, likely made of metal or plastic or some other harder material.  It also likely has an antenna,  a microphone and a speaker, and maybe a couple of dials to increase value  or the frequency of the radio signal, or whichever radio signal that you are communicating on. or whichever radio signal that you are communicating on. The object is used for communication.  I'm not an expert on this,  but from my understanding, it transmits the radio frequencies on a specific level.  I want to say pitch, but I know that's not the correct term. And that is outcasted to receiving radios which will relay the desired message as long as they’re on the same frequency."
tulip014,pocketradio,2,"The object presented was made of plastic. Other radios might be made of different material.

It can be made of any  number of materials as long as they're generally firm, so wood, plastic, metal. The object's function is to assist in putting your shoes on without the lip getting caught.  If I'm correct, this works by first putting the object in your shoe and then sliding your foot over it and then pulling the object out so that it catches the lip so that it doesn't fold."

If not, they're circular, but I'm pretty sure they're round.  Plastic, thin, yeah. The object is a method of storage. It is an outdated USB.  It is inserted into computers, older computers, I should say. There's not really any use for floppy disks anymore. There just has been a lot of technological advancements.  But at the time when they were used,  you would insert it into the computer, into the designated,  the designated port, and it was used as a hard drive.  But without, you know, an external hard drive, I should say, because it was able to be removed and inserted into other computers."
tulip014,floppydisk,2,"The floppy disk is a thin very square plastic device. Um it has a small slider on the top as well as what looks to be an unlocking apparatus towards the bottom. It’s very small, almost like a power switch size, like from the old DS’s, they would haveon the side that you can flip up or down. So it’s much smaller and thin it doesn’t have any external bits on that. But the top sliding bit on that is um it’s got a spring that pushes it back into the starting position and the rest is just all uh black plastic in  The objects function, as previously stated,  it is a storage for older computers,  as there's not a modern application for them, as there have been technological advancements that make the floppy disk dated and irrelevant. It was used by... The way you used it was you would put it into the port specifically. You might even have to have slid that slider at the top.  I'm not entirely sure, as I don't have much experience using them.  But you would insert it,  and it would be like an external storage hard drive, however you want to refer to it as."
tulip014,fishingreel,1,"Typically there's a few different variations of fishing reels. The easiest of the three is that they're on the ugly sticks. You just press the button.  There's a spool of wire contained inside of a protected sheath, if you will. There's another one where it's exposed. It's arguably more common than the previous one. The way that it works is... I shouldn't say it works yet. It has almost a lever that stops the... stops or allows the line to be used. And then there's also a hybrid of the two where it's more rectangular.  And I'm forgetting the name of these now, but it has exposed line as well as, I think, a button that you can press on. Generally these are made of plastic or metal. With a spool of fishing line. It's a... Which is like a rope material of some... I'm not sure the material for the line. It might be plastic or something else that I'm not aware of. Yeah. The objects... All work through the same mechanisms. Essentially the line is locked and unable to move without the...  You're using the mechanism, so if that's the button or if that's unlatching the clip  to let the spool run, And then you would... You would use the momentum of the rod to cast the string.  And when you're ready to stop the string, like if you land your cast where you want  it, you would let go of the button or close the clasp for the fishing reel."
tulip014,fishingreel,2," Typically, fishing rails, they have their own unique looks.  The one presented, which is what I'm going to emphasize and specify, is it has the central cylinder with the spool of fishing line. It's on a bearing system that will allow it to spin. There's also... There's an attached handle that allows you to spin the bearings. And there is a clasp on the top that opens or shuts to allow the release of the fishing line. The object is used for fishing. The way that it works is you... have a few different mechanisms on it. There's a mechanism at the top that I failed to mention last time  that increases or decreases the slack of the line, or how tight it's resisting.  So when the fish is on the line, if it's fighting a lot,  you don't want to have a tense line, otherwise it'll break.  You want it to be a little looser, allow it to pull more, even if it's locked. Then  You have the locking mechanism that allows for the release, or... the locking of the fishing line. That would be...  When you cast, you would unlock it,  pinch the line, throw it, and release. That would allow it to take the line with it as it's going.  And then once it's in your desired location, you would close it. There's also the handle that connects to the bearings. That allows for you to wind and retract the line. And that lets you reel in the fish. It's a reel."

tulip015,rolodex,2,"I think it's made of many papers and also the stales to put the paper around it.  And also every, there's some white paper and blue ones and on the blue ones there's some capital letters on the top of it. I think it's like work for people in the office to write something on it and to make it easier to find the notes on which people have listed on them because it has the capital letter  to help the people to, pretty convenient to find their notes."
tulip015,fishingreel,1," For this fishing reel, I think it's made of stales and also, like, made of some straws. to help and it's pretty long. For this one I think it's help people to fishing and also to to put the fish food on it and make the to attract the fish and catch them."

tulip015,bloodpressurecuff,2,"For this one I think it can like... It's made of some... It have like something like a clock on the top of them. And also it have... Can make people to press it to test their blood pressure. But it's not made of hard materials or electronic. It’s something like You can do it by hand but don't need the material thing. I still think that it can let people to put their arms inside and to test their blood pressure."
tulip015,handmixer,1,"For this one i think it can... It can like help people to working like so it's probably made of hard materials and something like steel and also and you probably have a handle on it and it's pretty long I guess um for this I think that it can help people to working fixing anything or like probably using cooking or agriculture or fixing any mud um fixing anything in your home or something"
tulip015,handmixer,2,"so it's made of steel and look pretty long and it's also have handle on it and when we press the handle it can like spinning around at the bottom now I think this one is used for cooking and help people to mix cook make cake or something to make something to mix up the eggs"
tulip015,floppydisk,1," For this one, I think that it's It's probably like pretty long and made of hard materials.  I never seen these things before, so I'm not sure about that.  Um, I think it's used for like, like mixing things.  Um, I'm not sure."
tulip015,floppydisk,2," Actually, it's actually, it's very pretty small and also it's black and make of like plastics.  And there are some, uh, steel on it. And also it's very pretty flat.  Um, I know that it's used for print, printer, but actually I don't know what exactly to,  but I know that it's probably used to put in, in the printer."
tulip015,stethoscope,1," I think for this one, I think it looks pretty small.  And also like, but I'm not sure for what specific it looks like. I think it probably has some lines on it.  And for this one, I think it's for testing anything, like to detect anything like in the dark or on the water.  Um, because I never see this before."
tulip015,stethoscope,2," For this one, I think it's made of plastic.  Um, and also steel. And it has a long tube. And also it has a tester.  Um, for this one, I think it's like made, um,  used for the doctor to test if their patients have some heart problems, or if they are sick or not."
tulip015,pocketradio,1," For this one, because it says it's pocket radio, so I think it's pretty small and you can hold it in hand and put it in the pocket. And it's probably made of steel and also can have some button to press it. It can make people to put in the pocket and listen to this small radio when they're walking or in the private time."
tulip015,pocketradio,2,"Now I think it's still pretty small and but it is made of plastic and also some little bit of steel.  And also it's very light when I put it, holding it, so it's not very heavy when people put it inside a pocket. And I do think that it can help make people to put inside their pocket to listen to a video when they’re in their private time or walking in the street."
tulip015,shoehorn,1,"I think for this one it's made of plastic and I don't think that it's like a heavy thing and I think it's probably pretty long or something. I think it's used for fixing shoes."
tulip015,shoehorn,2," Actually, after seeing this, I think that it's made of steel and it's pretty hard and flat.  I'm actually not familiar with this object before, so I still think that it's probably made of like fixing shoes or something."
tulip016,bulbplanter,1," Okay, so I don't know what a bulb planter is. I'm assuming it has to be a metal tool of some sort where you can dig a hole to plant a bulb of some plant.  I don't actually know what that tool looks like or what it is, so I'd love to actually look at it and learn more. That's everything that I think it could be. The only bulb other option would be a light bulb.  That doesn't make any sense, so it has to be some sort of tool or object. I'm picturing something that's like trowel-shaped. That's anything I can think of.  Right, so I think that this object has to dig holes. In the ground to plant this bulb of something.  I know you can plant bulbs for certain plants, so maybe this was made specifically for a certain type of plant to dig a hole in the ground for."
tulip016,bulbplanter,2,"So bulb planter is a metal device that has a cylindrical bottom and it has a handlebar at the top for your hand to grip and it has little bumps at the very bottom of the metal cylinder which I will describe in the next section what that is meant to do and on the sides of the cylinder there are markers of centimeters ranging from one centimeter to five centimeters and you had a you have a notification on your hard plastic for your hand to grip onto and the handle is screwed in to the metal cylinder and that is the visual of the bulb planner okay so the bulb planter is planter is used to create perfectly a perfect size to implant some sort of bulb of a plant into the ground so it's meant to you're meant to grip the top hander and then you're meant to grip the top handel and push the bulb planter into some sort of dirt or ground to make the initial impact and then you're meant to twist it and pull out the dirt so that you have that perfect hole to plant the the bulb of the plant into and you can measure specifically how many centimeters you want to pull out of the ground by looking at the sides of the bulb planter and you insert it into the ground and see where the ground meets the marker to figure out how many centimeters of dirt you're pulling out of the ground."
tulip016,pocketradio,1,"Okay.  From my memory, a pocket radio is a, it's a rectangular device that, um, pocket radio makes me believe that this is a small radio that can fit in the pocket of one's pants. Um. I picture a rectangular gray metal device that has a circular sort of stereo to project sound out of.  Uh, there should be buttons on the rectangular device to change to AM or FM radio.  Uh, on the side there should be a spiral, uh, cylinder to rotate. With your fingers to change volume size.  Uh, I mean, yes, volume size.  And then there should also be some sort of, uh, I'm picturing some sort of like metal wire of some sort at the top of the rectangular device for a connection to radio signals.  And, uh, that's what I think it looks like. Okay.  A pocket radio is basically meant to be a regular radio, which is a device that takes  in radio waves and puts them through a stereo for you to be able to listen to it, projects it outwardly. Uh. And  You can control how loud that is or what station the, what signal the radio is picking  up, uh, based on the buttons and controls on the radio.  For it to be a pocket radio, you'll, you'll be able to fit it in your pocket and that makes it portable.  So it's supposedly a light, small rectangle of some sort.  And then the, the antenna. Or. The wire coming out of the pocket radio is meant to pick up those radio signals."
tulip016,pocketradio,2,""
tulip016,handmixer,1," Okay, so a hand mixer is a metal stick of some sort.  It's a metal stick that at the bottom is a little flared and it's able, it has little serrated edges and it has a handle at the top.  It is, so majority of the hand mixer is a cold metal. It is a reflective metal of some sort.  And then typically a handle has, it's going to be hard plastic.  Typically it's like the color black, I don't know, it's an aesthetic choice that a lot of hand mixers have.  Other than that, that's what a hand mixer looks like from memory. I could be 100% wrong.  Okay, hand mixers are used to blend objects. By objects I mean food.  Typically hand mixers are used to blend, say fruit into smoothies, or if you're making a soup and you want to have a less texture and you want the food to be more well broken  up into a liquid or almost liquid, you would use a hand mixer to crush the material in a much faster efficient way than doing it by hand."
tulip016,handmixer,2," Okay, so a hand mixer is kind of like a massive whisk. It has two whisk. Um.  Uh, shapes connected to each other and the, the two whisks that are connected to each other are made of stainless steel and these whisks rotate as they are connected to a plastic  wheel, hard plastic.  And the wheel is connected to a hand crank, which is a bent shape of stainless steel metal  with a hard plastic, uh, end for your hand to grip onto.  And above that, the stainless steel stick continues up and there is a hard plastic stick at the top to grab onto with your hand.  Uh, in this example, the hard plastic was the color blue.  Uh, some sort of Robins blue.  The hand mixer itself is kind of a difficult shape to describe, but it is a, uh, the whisk shape at the bottom of the hand mixer is made up of four J's upside down with a little bit of a  long, uh, ball shaped ball.  Uh, there are two of those that rotate opposite to each other. So one rotates clockwise. One rotates counterclockwise.  Uh, as the wheel rotates, yes. Okay. Okay.  So a hand mixer is used to blend, blend food. This type of hand mixer is used for baking as it is. I can tell because it is a hand mixer.  It assumes the shape of a whisk, but it's like a giant mega whisk. It's multiple whisks that are paired together that rotate simultaneously due to the wheel they're attached to and the hand crank.  And as the hand crank moves by a circular motion of the hand, the wheel rotates, rotating one whisk in a counterclockwise motion and the other in a clockwise motion. So that both whisks meet in the middle and whatever material is being whisked or blended at the bottom will be blended more seamlessly. Hand mixers are used in baking.  You see this when people are typically mixing together dough or you can see it when they're mixing together some sort of liquid ingredients to create, say, whipped cream with heavy cream. It typically is used in a kitchen by someone who doesn't mind using a little extra hand strength to make a dish of some sort or bake a baked good. But. It's a little easier than using a hand whisk because that takes a longer amount of time. So this is a time efficient tool."
tulip016,rolodex,1,"Rolodex. I am familiar with the word. Rolodex is a. This is sort of an older device.  What it looks like from what I think it is, is a. It's a. A metal wheel. It's a. It's a metal stainless steel stand that makes a triangle shape. And there are two metal triangles that hold up a metal rod.  And of the metal rod, there are pieces of paper, small rectangles with personal information written on them. And a Rolodex is made up of an alphabetical order of. People's personal information. So it's just a bunch of papers ordered next to each other in alphabetical order. There is a sort of hand crank to rotate these papers typically. Okay. So a Rolodex is used to. It's sort of like what you would see in a book. It's like a. A. A list of everyone's personal information that you know. It's a way to. It's a way to have a. A person's. Information. It's an older way to get.  Look up people's information, but it's typically used. I've seen it used in movies for office settings. When.  You're trying to look up someone's information, you'll.  You'll see them go through their Rolodex and they'll say, yes, I found this card for this one person's information. It typically has a name and address. Maybe their relation to you. And they're just a list of people's personal information. Okay."
tulip016,rolodex,2,"Okay so a rolodex is a stand in this case we have a metal stand, a black metal stand where two. It’s one long metal piece that uh curves downward and then it makes a U-shape so it comes back up and around so it creates this stand of which these paper cards are threaded through a metal bar. And on both sides of this metal bar there are these giant uh circular plastic caps that have grooves in them so that they are tactically easier to grip onto and rotate so that you can flip over the papers attached to the metal bar. There is enough paper to cover over 75% of this metal bar. There is a lot of paper  and these small rectangular pieces of paper about I'd say three inches by one inch,  maybe not, they are separated by these little,  um, they're separated by letters, by a different colored sheet of paper.  In this case, there was a blue cardboard paper with a white letter of an alphabet, of a letter on these sections and it went through A all the way to Z. Only the last  section X, Y, and Z were paired together probably because they were less common to have,  uh,  information about typically, uh,  I, yeah, it, there's a metal bar, uh, two caps on the side to rotate and a bunch of paper.  Okay, so a rolodex is a tool that you, uh, set on a desk,  typically, is seen in an office or private setting where you can keep track of people's personal information  and you alphabetize the information. Typically, you would do by last name,  you could do first name, it's up to you, but you have sections A through Z  where X, Y, Z is paired together because they are less common, um, Um and you would  you would set the metal bars, the metal bar section onto the desk and rotate the plastic caps  to the desired section of the Rolodex in order to find the specific information you're looking for,  which will include typically a name, some sort of contact information, maybe a phone number,  an address, and then maybe how they're related to you in some way, like how you know them."
tulip016,threeholepunch,1," Okay, so a three-hole punch is a rectangular object. It is longer than the length of a typical printer paper. I'd say it's typically about a foot and a couple of inches longer.  Wait, no, no, no, no, no. That's incorrect. It is longer than the length of printer paper. That's true.  It's typically made of two metal, two rectangular pieces of metal. All of the hole punchers that I've seen have had the color black.  And then on the inside, there is a section for you to, there is a section to line up paper. And then there are three metal prongs. And there is a spring mechanism inside of the two metal bars so that the two metal bars are permanently at an angle so that the bars are only touching on one side that is the long length side. Okay.  So a three-hole punch, three-hole punch tool is used to punch three holes into paper.  People do this for school or for work or for just organizing papers that they have for binders, typically. Or some a sort of a folder that has prongs in it for you to put paper into to store. So you would insert paper into the three-hole punch. And then you would press down on the top metal bar and you would hear a crunch. And that would be the three prongs punching three holes into the paper of a standardized size. Okay. That fits majority of binders.  And so you would just put in some papers, maybe put in a stack of papers, punch the hole, and then you would use the papers for the binder or whatever you're putting your papers into. Okay."
tulip016,threeholepunch,2,"Okay so a three hole punch is a device that has two metal bars, one on the thinner side one is lighter than the other, in this case we have a grey metal bar and a second metal bar that is a little bit thicker that is black, and it is the same length as the first bar.  Both of these bars, the length is slightly longer than printer paper. And their width is a little bit... I don't know. The top of the gray metal bar is not a perfect rectangle. It curves on one side so that... I will explain in the next section why. And the three-hole punch has three metal prongs on the bottom of the gray bar that have a small shape of a half semicircle cutout. Out of each of them. And attached to each of those metal prongs is a metal spring. And those...  Between both metal bars, there is a metal sort of structured device to go around the prong on the top bar.  The gray bar and the black bottom metal bar, which connects both of these bars together.  On the inside, there is a bump...  There's a level up higher, so it's not completely... Okay.  So for the black metal bar, there is a little notch in the middle.  On the inside, there is a little notch inside that runs along the entire length of the bar that stops any paper from moving forward or past that section. And that is what makes a three-hole punch. Okay. So a three-hole punch is used to punch three holes into paper.  It creates three standardized holes that fit into binders or other type of document holding items, such as folders with three prongs with the same width as a binder. These are used in office and school settings typically for those who have pieces of paper that are printed out with important information that they would like to store for later use.  So a person would take said paper and they would put it into the three-hole punch, which would be stopped by the raised level of the bottom black bar so that you can have a perfect symmetrical line of three holes punched into the paper.  In order to punch the holes into the paper, you set the device on the table, insert the paper, and then you put your hand on the top metal bar and you press down, which will push down all three prongs. And then you have three metal prongs attached to the top metal bar. And that semicircle cutout of each metal prong is meant to make it easier to remove from the paper once you're done pushing down on top.  Once that is done, you can remove your piece of paper and then it has three holes in it."
tulip016,fishingreel,1," Okay, so a fishing reel is a metal item that is two metal circles connected in the center with a metal bar attached on the exterior side of one of the circles.  There is a handle, which means there is a slight extension of the bar that also goes up. And there's also some sort of hard plastic handle attached to the metal. And the fishing reel typically has fishing wire wrapped around it.  If we're talking about a full fishing reel,  visually, I know what a fishing rod is. I'm assuming that a fishing reel is that section of a fishing rod. Where fishing line is wrapped around. So that is all that I can describe about the fishing reel. A fishing reel is used to hold fishing line for a fishing rod so that a person who is fishing with a fishing rod can cast back the reel and throw fishing line into whatever body of water they are catching fish. And then they can use the handle to crank back the fishing line so that whatever they catch on the end of the fishing rod will be retrieved back to them."
tulip016,fishingreel,2,"Okay so a fishing reel is made, it can be made out of metal which uh I don’t know which kind of metal. It can be made out of metal or hard plastic. This is typically uh something that is attached to a fishing rod so this is a bar that has a handle attached to it made of hard plastic shaped to a grip and there is uh a metal cylinder that holds fishing line attached to the top of this device. In this fishing reel we have a thin metal wire that is stretched into the shape of the U. As you crank the handle there is some sort of rotary mechanics there rotating the metal wire around the fishing line. And there is some sort of bent flat metal at the base of the fishing reel which I assume will be attached to a fishing rod. This fishing reel has a certain type of gear or it uh it has a specific number on the base of it indicating maybe a specific type of fishing reel, uh and the hand crank could be rotated clockwise and counterclockwise of which the metal U would be rotated one way or the opposite way depending on how you rotated the hand crank. So a fishing reel, a fishing rod I’m getting less and less sure. A fishing reel is attached to  a fishing rod where you cast a certain amount of fishing line to a fishing rod to fish. I have said fish many times uh you cast the rod back and you cast the line into a body of water and you would stop and rotate back the hand crank onto the fishing reel so that the fishing line is taught and then if you feel yanking on the fishing line indicating something is caught, hopefully a fish, you rotate the hand crank and a uh in a clockwise motion that is towards you so that the fishing line is retracted and pulls back whatever the fishing rod had caught into the air"
tulip017,threeholepunch,1,""
tulip017,threeholepunch,2,"Yeah this object is typically made out of metal. It is uh long rectangular shaped. It has a piece of metal attached to the top of it that when you press down, it has these like three things also made out of metal that go through the paper or whatever you’re trying to hole punch to create a hole. It’s best used for papers that don’t already have hole punches so that you can add them into the binder with three rings."
tulip017,frenchpress,1,""
tulip017,frenchpress,2,"I don't know anything about this object.  This object, based off the example that I've seen, is made out of glass. It has a handle attached to it. And there is a lid that has a straw that goes inside this kettle-like object with what looks like to be a filter.  After playing around with it, I think that it is used for filtering.  For example, if you like, um, just to like filter chunks out of like water or liquid like, uh, liquid like."

tulip017,crankflashlight,1,"I think is a very very bright flashlight probably used for camping I think that's a really really bright flashlight that is yeah again used for camping or to see really really dark areas around for like an unfamiliar areas"
tulip017,crankflashlight,2,"So it is a flashlight Except it's not very bright Um It's It kinda looks like Like the body Like it's built kinda like the body of a fish Except without a head Um It has a lever attached to it That you can twist I don't know what it does But I'm guessing that it's used to Higher or darken the light Uh The example that I saw was made out of plastic Um I still think that it's used for camping Or maybe like more mechanical Um Mechanical stuff It works by Uh Pressing a button that is located to the side of it Which Triggers the light And then Rotating the lever Which I think either increases or decreases The intensity of the flashlight"
tulip017,handmixer,1,"A hand mixer is made out of metal.  It's like a whisk that you use to whisk up eggs, cake batter, pancake mix. And it has pieces of metal that kind of interwind together.

tulip017,handmixer,2," Okay, so it is indeed made out of metal. It has what seems to be two bulbs that are made out of metal. And they have lines of metal that go around kind of interwinding. Um... There is a lever attached to the side of it that you spin that moves the two mixers. Uh... Mixers look at the bottom of the metal rod. It's made out of metal and it looks like a rod with two bulbs. Uh... It's made out of metal. Metal looks at the bottom with a lever to the side that you can kind of spin to move the two mixers located at the end of it.  I think that it is used for, or no, I know it's used for mixing stuff like eggs, cake  batter, pancake mix, whipped cream.  Just mixing spices as well, that could be a thing."
tulip017,pocketradio,1,"A pocket radio is made out of metal or plastic.  It is a very, very small radio that... I guess...  that is portable, I can just carry around in your pocket, just hence the name.  It is used to listen to different channels, usually the news or music."
tulip017,pocketradio,2,"It is made out of plastic. It has an antenna located to its top side.  Like, on the top of it. It has... It has kind of like this... thing that you can slide to choose what channel you want to listen to. It is battery powered and it doesn't need... electricity.  Again, it is made out of plastic. It has an antenna to the top of it that I guess helps signal the channels better. Or the frequency. Umm...  It is used for listening to music, news...  you know, to keep in touch with what's going on around the world. Or around your surroundings."
tulip017,bloodpresurecuff,1,"A blood pressure cuff is made out of plastic and it's kind of like a wrap that goes around your bicep to check the pressure of your blood and how much your heartbeats are it's made out of plastic and it wraps around your bicep or right below your bicep kind of where your elbow is to check for your heartbeats and the pressure of your blood"
tulip017,bloodpresurecuff,2,""
tulip017,bloodpressurecuff,1,""
tulip017,bloodpressurecuff,2,"So it is a piece of plastic that wraps around the area between your bicep and your elbow.  It has kind of like, kind of similar to what a balloon looks like attached to it that you compress and it helps build up air into the plastic alongside, not a compass but kind of looks like a watch and it measures how much the pressure is."
tulip017,stethoscope,1,"stethoscope is usually made out of metal and silicone  it has, it's like a string and then on one end it has kind of like a v-shaped v-shaped object that goes into your ears and then on the other end it has a round shaped piece of metal that goes on your heart you place the v-shaped on your ears and you attach the circular end to either your heart or somebody else's heart so it listens to their heart beats and it gives you helps you hear their heart beats and to check that they have regular heart rhythm"
tulip017,stethoscope,2," Yeah, so like I said earlier, it is a piece of string that is made out of, it is like a string that is made out of silicone, maybe it makes out of silicone and plastic, on one end it has a V-shape that can open and close to fit, to accommodate to the size of someone's head,  and on the other hand, it has a sphere-shaped piece of metal, and it looks like there is a filter located on that round-shaped metal to help, I don't know, I guess, help hear the heartbeats.  You put the V-shaped end on your ears, and then you attach the metal shape to your heart. And whatever you want to listen to"
tulip017,floppydisk,1,"I'm guessing that it's a disc that is very bendable.  Um, usually meant to be played by an antique videotape player."
tulip017,floppydisk,2,"The object looks like a square. It is square shaped and it's made out of plastic. And in the middle there is a circular piece. I believe made out of metal.  The metal is pretty bendable and I still think that it is meant to be used for videotapes, music, maybe CDs, or to store it. Something around that genre."
tulip017,bulbplanter,1,"I don't know what this is. I don't know."
tulip017,bulbplanter,2,"Plant light bulbs  Which is, yeah.  Yeah, it's meant to be used to plant light bulbs  safely, without accidentally, I guess, harming yourself in any way."
tulip017,shoehorn,1,"I don't know. I don't know."
tulip017,shoehorn,2," Yeah, so a shoehorn is made out of also heavy metal.  But it comes, well this example is made out of heavy metal, but there are other shoehorns that are made out of hard plastic. Yes.  Yeah, made out of hard plastic. This one's made out of very hard metal.  It's kind of shaped like a very long rectangle, except it's curved. It's curved. It's curved at the ends of it. You place this object behind your heel to help you put your shoes on. To help your heel easily slip into your shoe without much force."
tulip018,rolodex,1," I'm not really sure what a Rolodex looks like, or what it's made of. I'm not sure how it works or what it's used for either. I really don't know."
tulip018,rolodex,2,"I think that it's... Oh.  It looks like that it has two different knobs on the side, and is made of a bunch of paper flaps. And I think it's made of a plastic cap.  And also, it's made of a plastic and paper.  I'm not really sure what it's used for, but it might be used for organizing.  And I think it works like, you turn the knob, and each flap opens up, and it just goes in a cycle."
tulip018,shoehorn,1," I don't really know what a shoehorn is, but just based off of the name, I'm assuming that it probably is something used for your shoe, and it probably looks like a shoe, so it's, um, like an oval shape on your foot, and then with, like, a horn, so it makes, like, noise. And I think that's kind of how it works.  It, like, makes noise.  Then it's on your shoe, but I'm not really sure what it's used for."
tulip018,shoehorn,2," Um, I think, okay, now that, like, I've looked at it, I think it looks like, it looks more, it's like, it looks kind of like something that you would use to take off a shoe or put on, like, socks.  I, um, it's kind of like in the shape of a foot, almost, and then it's, like, made of metal.  Um, I think that it might work to help remove a shoe or, like, slide on socks because it's kind of in that shape."
tulip018,handmixer,1," Okay, so a hand mixer kind of looks like a bunch of different wires combined together,  and you kind of press a button to help mix whatever ingredients you want, and I think it's normally made out of metal.  And sometimes the top part is made out of plastic, and it's kind of just a bunch of wires in like a sphere shape or an oval sphere shape.  And how it works is you kind of press the top of the button to like mix whatever ingredients you want to mix, and it's normally used for like cooking and like to mix a bunch of like items together."
tulip018,handmixer,2," Okay, so now like based off of what I just saw, what the hand mixer looks like,  I think it has like, it has a handle where you can like roll it to mix the spheres at the top, and I think it is made of metal and kind of plastic.  And it works by like moving the lever around,  and then it's used for the same thing to mix any items, mix any ingredients."
tulip018,floppydisk,1,"I think a floppy disk typically... I think it's also made of plastic or some sort of metal. And I think it looks like it's kind of in a... in a circle shape? If it's like a disk. And I think  it's like, um... I think it's... it has like a hole in the middle and it has like a circle kind of in a donut shape. Um... And I think how it works  is like, it's normally in computers  or like a CD player, but what it's used for is like it has like media on it and then it kind of plays after you put it in the media player."
tulip018,floppydisk,2," Okay, so now that I've looked  at it, I think that it looks more of like in a square shape and it has a little  metal circle in this, um... on one side of it. And it...  Um, I think it's made out of plastic and metal too. And I think how it works is that  like, you can still put it in the player.  I think it could be in, um... in a laptop or in a computer. And then it's used for like... it has information  in it. And, um... It has information in it that  when you put it into the computer, like, it shows up on the computer."
tulip018,bulbplanter,1,"um a bulb planter I think it's what is used for um I think it's what like light bulbs go into and I think that it's probably made of plastic and I think it has like it probably looks like um I'm not really sure I think it's I think it might be like in a in like around a shape where like the bulb the outside of a bulb could go into um um and then I think how it works is like it's for a light bulb and I think what it's used for is um to hold onto a light bulb in the ceiling or in wherever the light bulb should go"
tulip018,bulbplanter,2,"Okay now that I’ve looked at it, it typically looks like it has a handle on top and it’s more of like a cylinder shape a hollow cylinder shape  and I think it's made out of steel or metal, some sort of metal, and it has like measurements on the side of it and also I think that like the handle attached is more of like a rectangle shape with curved endings. And I'm not really sure how it works but I think it might be like you could put a plant  inside of it and then you use it for, you use it to plant like in soil instead not like a light bulb as I said earlier and I think it might be for like plants and then you could put the plant inside of the hollow cylinder and then put it in the soil."
tulip018,crankflashlight,1," Okay, I think a crank flashlight might look like, it might be like a cylinder, and I'm  assuming that a cylinder with like a flatter surface, so, and it has like light coming  out of it for like how a normal flashlight works, and I think that it might be made out  of, um, I'm not really sure what it's made out of, but, yeah, I'm not really sure what it's made out of.  And I think how it works is that a crank, like, so it might be like a lever type, like  how the mixer was, and I think that based off of that, like the light comes out, and using that mechanism.  You can have light, and it's probably used for like, um, used to look, used to provide  light for like in dark areas, and like when people are out, it's like an emergency tool almost."
tulip018,crankflashlight,2," It typically looks like, um, almost like a flat-ish cylinder, and, um, flat-ish cylinder,  and it has like, has like a little crank mechanism on the side of it, and it also has like a  switch for the light to come out, and then the, the, um, one side has a handle, and the  other side has more, has the light, and it's like, and, yeah, I think that that's how it  kind of looks like, and I'm still not really sure what it's made of. The outside kind of looks like it's made of rubber.  And then, I think the object, I thought initially that it would be the cranking mechanism that  would make the light come out, but it's just an on and off switch, and I think that this  is normally used for like, when people go out and like need light, emergency light,  I think that that's what this would come in handy for, because it's very like, transportable."
tulip018,stethoscope,1,"Okay typically a stethoscope has like a um two wires attached to the top in like a U-shape and those two wires have like one wire in a U shape and there’s like another wire attached to the top tip of that U-shape. And then there is normally like the ear valves on the top of each side of the top of the U and then on the bottom there’s like another part to like listen to the heart beat. And it’s made of, I want to say rubber but I’m not really sure and like metal. And I think the object works you would put the two circles in your ears and you would use the other tip of the wire to listen to the heart of the person. And it’s normally used in doctors offices to check on if the person’s heart is beating."
tulip018,stethoscope,2,"Okay, now that I‘ve looked at it instead of a U shape it’s more of a flat um a U but with the top kind of closed more flat. And I think the bottom is more like easy to move. And I think that originally I didn’t think that it was as long as I looked it and I still think that is made out of rubber and also metal. And then I think it works the same way  I think you put the two valves in your ears, and then the bottom part is used to like, measure the heartbeat of a person."
tulip018,frenchpress,1,"I think a French press typically is made of metal and I think it's more it's kind of in a rectangular shape I'm not really sure and then I think that I'm not really sure how it works or what it's used for it might be used for coffee but I'm not necessarily sure"
tulip018,frenchpress,2,"okay now that I've looked at it I think it typically looks like a cylinder with a handle attached and also like a spout to like pour out whatever it makes and I think it's like made out of glass and like a little bit of metal and it kind of it's like there's a container and then inside of the container there's a pressing object to like I'm assuming to press coffee beans I think it is used for coffee and once you press the top of it it can make coffee"
tulip018,fishingreel,1,"Um I think a fishing reel typically looks like a rod with like a wire attached and I think it’s probably made of metal and string and I think it has a little, I think it has a little um ranking mechanism too to like have the wire come back. And I think how it works is that it’s used to get fish and how it works is that if you put the use the rod to use the wire to use the string to go into the water then the string it catches fish on it and you can kind of put bait on it and then get fish"
tulip018,fishingreel,2,""
tulip018,threeholepunch,1,"Okay a three hole punch typically looks like its like a long rectangular shape with three holes, one on one end one in the middle and one on the other end. And it’s typically made of metal too. It’s kind of, it has a base to it and then the top half where you click the top to punch the holes in the paper. And typically how it works is that if you click down on something, on the paper then the holes punch out and then what it’s used for is to punch out holes in a paper so that you can put it in a binder."
tulip018,threeholepunch,2,"Okay I think it looks like it typically does have a rectangle base attached and then on top it does have more of a curved rectangular base and it is made of metal but I also did notice that it’s made of springs too in each of the hole punches. So in order to actually click down on the hole punch. And um I think that if you click down on the top, you can pierce the holes in the paper and it’s used for piercing holes in paper."
tulip018,pocketradio,1,"Okay, a pocket radio I’m not really sure how this looks like or what it’s made of but I’m assuming that it might be kind of um it might look more of I think I would picture it to be a rectangular shape with a little circle in the middle to like listen to the radio. And I think what it’s made of is I think it might be made of plastic but I’m not really sure. Also I could see it being made of metal. And I think it might just be a portable radio so I think how it works is that it just catches waves and that’s what it could be and it’s used to listen to the radio, it’s a little portable radio."
tulip018,pocketradio,2,"Okay now that I've looked at I noticed it is in a rectangular shape and it, I’m still not really sure of what it’s made of, but I noticed it has a metal antenna and I think the metal antenna is attached to the top of the rectangle. And I think how it works is that antennae catches waves and I think based off the frequency of those waves, you hear different things and I think that’s kind of what it’s used for to listen to the waves."
tulip018,bloodpressurecuff,1," Um I think a blood pressure cuff typically looks like a big, um, it's kind of like a bracelet type, but made of, like, like, uh, I want to say  malleable material, because I don't really know what it's made of, but I think it's,  it's something that you can put around your wrist, and then, or not your wrist, wherever  you measure blood pressure, and I think that that's, and it has, like, it's kind of in  a circle shape, so I think that's what it looks like. I think how it works is that it  measures the blood pressure of someone, and I think that's kind of what it's used for.  Um, I think it goes based off of your pulse, to figure out the blood pressure."
tulip018,bloodpressurecuff,2," Okay, now that I've looked through it, I noticed that it's a lot bigger than I first imagined.  It's a huge rectangular shape that you can wrap around your arm, and it's made out of  velcro, and also it does have, like, it has, like, a little pump, a wire attached to it,  so where you can, like, put, um, there's, like, a little circle at the end of the wire,  where you press it, and, um, based off of that, like, the little clock, like, the, not  clock, the scale, it kind of changes to how much the blood pressure.  I think how it works is you press on the, the pump, and it's used to measure blood pressure."
tulip019,floppydisk,1,"I'm assuming it's like a disk for either like something you put in like a PC or like a sort of memory card thing.  So I'll describe it to be either really small or compact, maybe circle, like in a circle, like a regular CD.  But I'm not sure if it's actually that, but I would assume it's, you know, circle, like look like a CD or either like an SD card.  And yeah, for a PC or laptop.  I think this, oh, this object is used for to either maintain storage or to play a sort of video. Okay.  Whichever is, whichever, so whoever programs it and just what it's used for. I could have a lot of different things. It could probably be for to upload a video or game or anything or to update something in a manual software. But that's what I think what I would say."
tulip019,floppydisk,2,"It definitely is like a square shape. It looks older than I think it is.  I think it's like a little bit bigger than I remember, but I think, yeah. It also has like a mechanism that you could choose to lock or unlock it. It has like a silver metal plating.  But yeah, it's definitely for a lot older generation since it does says like it had a 1.44 megabytes, I think.  But yeah, I think, yeah, now back then for sure, the bigger they were, that's as much storage as they hold.  But yeah, definitely not, not in the shape of a CD, but it's more of like a square. Well how it works, I'm pretty sure you just manually input it in like a PC or computer and whatever storage  it has in that, you know, floppy disk is what you could see on the computer uploaded or whatever.  Like you could have like update, like I said, or just videos or just documents.  But yeah, that's what I would assume it is for."
tulip019,rolodex,1,"Rolodex. I'm not sure what this object is. Maybe I'm going to assume it's a watch from like a Rolex. I'm not sure. Rolodex. I'm going to just assume from what I don't know of the object. I would assume it's a watch. So it would be something you tie around your wrist and has the time. And you could tell what time it is or something. But I'm not sure. I would assume this object works with mechanisms inside of it. You will basically be able to tell the time. All 24 hours, I guess. 12 hour intervals, I think.  And yeah, you could manually change the time to adjust it. One time changes.  And yeah, that's all. Just to keep time."
tulip019,rolodex,2," Well, now seeing how it looks, definitely it looks like a spinning wheel.  But inside it, it's like they have multiple business cards. And it looks very organized. It's alphabetical order. it stands up on his own with like a little stand right below it the one I did look at was black but yeah it just has a thing where you could spin around and you could just turn it to go to the next business card I'd say this object works with like where you could organize certain business cards or information on certain like little flashcards of like depending on what you are looking for it has alphabetical order I'd assume would be used for office settings when you have like when you want to keep track of who you're contacting it could probably have like you know their personal info their number just ways to contact them or just just little facts about whichever business card or person you're writing about in that relics and as you spin it you could it's organized from a to Z"
tulip019,bloodpressurecuff,1,"Uh blood pressure cuff I’m assuming it’s the plastic wrap you wrap around your arm to take the blood pressure so it would have a comfortable in line I guess so when it wraps around your arm it doesn’t really bother you. I would assume it has some velcro straps and some wording on the side maybe directions how to use it or apply it to better read your blood pressure. It might be attached to like a plastic tube with like a maybe a little ball you could squish and it just puts pressure on your arm and so it could take your blood pressure. How this object works, like I was saying there might be a ball you squeeze and the blood pressure cuff just adds pressure on your arm. It is used to track your blood pressure to see if you’re healthy or not, and just to assess your health I think um and it’s mainly used for EMTs or like hospitals and yeah it’s just a good way to like assess your health"
tulip019,bloodpressurecuff,2," So yeah, it does typically look like it has like Velcro on it so it could wrap around  your arm and it also has you know wording, directions on how to apply it on the arm,  left arm or right arm. It does have a metal like a plastic, well sort of like soft plastic rubber on it and by the rubber ball where you squeeze to apply more pressure and it also has like a domitor to just see it scales on where your blood pressure ranges on that. And yeah it is blue and does have like the direction and it does look like it is used to just. Take your blood pressure.  How this object is used, you wrap it around your left or right arm and you squeeze the rubber ball  and depending on how much your blood pressure is, how high it is, it will show on the scale and it  will determine whether or not you have high blood pressure or low blood pressure. It is, yeah, that's  make sure, I think when you apply it you have to like you know make sure you just have your shirt and you just wrap it around your arm and. Touch the vocal area."
tulip019,shoehorn,1,"A shoe horn? Um I’m sot sure what the object maybe I’m just going to assume it’s some sort of horn, maybe it makes a noise I'm not familiar.  It does sound familiar, but I can't think of anything at the moment of what the object looks like or what it may do. I don't know how this object works. I'm not sure what it would be used for. I'm not confident in assuming that it's maybe something for a shoe  or something with a horn, but it might be something.  The object looks like something that, it's a metal, it's a metal curved plate, but it  looks like in the shape of like, not a shoe, but in a way where it helps you put on your shoe.  So, it's metal, it has a hole in it, there's curves on it, but the curves look like there's meant to be a foot in there to help you put on your shoe.  How the object works, I'd assume if you have like a formal shoe that you wouldn't want  to crease or any other sort of boot or whatever, or which shoe you have difficulty putting  on, you would just put it in the shoe before your foot and you would just slide in your  foot as you're using the shoe horn to just, you know, slide your foot in the shoe. That way it will cause less creases or any damage to the shoe depending on how delicate it is."

tulip019,pocketradio,1,"A pocket radio, I’m going to assume it’s one of the old radios that could clip onto  your shirt or pants depending on what generation it is I'm assuming it has you know buttons on it Aux cord where you could listen in it could have like you know batteries it could it could be shaped like a square it could be big or small I'm assuming it's gonna be a medium at least and yeah how this object works and what is used for I would say it is used for to listen to the radio or any sort of music that's on there might be a dial on it where you could change frequencies it is just used to as whatever if you could plug in their aux if that your phone's ever has our school you could listen in either with just your phones or you could maybe have it does it might be a speaker out and you could just listen outward and yeah Typically it was like an old timey radio. It is like a silver metal box with a large antenna that is used to get the frequencies. It has an FM scale and an AM scale, ranges from 0 to 10. In the back it does have a battery port where you insert batteries just to charge it or power it up. On the side it does have the volume dials. You can increase or lower the volume. The aux cord port. And yeah it does have a little screen but it is only just for you to see the ranges.  And in the middle of it, in the front of the whole pocket radio there is a big speaker that just in a circle. And you can just hear. That is where the volume or that is where the music comes out. How I assume the object works once you insert a battery and you adjust the antenna just to get a good range. You could listen to anything that is on a radio that you could get depending on the scales like zero to 10. You could have it just laying around and just being tuned in on whichever radio station you want. It could be music. It could just be people talking. It could be the news. But yeah it is just a pocket radio and depending on the antenna how good your service is.  Also depends, also determines how clear it is and stuff."

tulip019,bulbplanter,1,"I'm not sure. I'm going to assume it's the thing that you attach light bulbs to. It could be small. I guess just depending on the light bulb. And I'd assume that's just where you connect your light bulbs and just have that's where the light will be. I'm not sure what a bulb planter is. So I think that is just my best guess of how it would look. Maybe it would be metal. Maybe it would be compact or whichever. But I assume it wouldn't be fragile. I don't think it would be soft at all. So I think it's just going to be a metal plate where you would just attach a light bulb. I'd assume how it worked is  whichever, if there's a light bulb,  in it or on it, that is how the light bulb would turn on.  It would probably, it's just an attachment for the light bulb where it could just illuminate  whichever, wherever the bulb planner is or wherever it's connected to.  But, yeah."
tulip019,bulbplanter,2,"It looks like a metal plate. A lot bigger than i thought it has a nice handle where you i guess where you plant whichever you're planning uh it has some measurements on the side it has some little i guess screws on it that made the bulb planner uh but it's definitely taller uh the bottom uh definitely looks like it's something where you plant down on the floor or whichever and yeah it said it was made in vietnam uh definitely metal and there's a handle where to plant stuff but i'm not sure how it works i'm not sure what it's used for but i'm assuming based off of the handle you plant it on the floor or on the ground and yeah the measurements on the side you determine how deep you're going or how far up um yeah it definitely is a lot it's a physical object it definitely looks like a tool for something"
tulip019,handmixer,1,"I'm not sure what this hand mixer may be um i'm gonna assume it's another tool and i'm not sure what it's used for but i'm assuming it's a tool for something like that and i guess it's just something uh how it would look uh possibly small something that would fit in my hand and uh i'd say maybe maybe metal maybe it could be made of plastic um but definitely compact i'm whether be uh uh baking materials or uh sort of tools or gardening i guess um and just definitely to mix something up maybe that way you could use that instead of your own hand and it'll maybe probably make make the whole process a lot easier"
tulip019,handmixer,2,"This looks like a tool definitely for baking. It has two metal springs that once you spin the wheel that has attached on the left on  the side, the faster you spin it, the faster those wheels spin. And it's definitely just to be baking stuff.  It is made of metal, I guess, and has some plastic handling for you know where you spin the wheel and where you hold the hand mixer. It has like some screws attached to it. Definitely to bake stuff. And yeah.  How this works, the faster you spin the little handle on the side, the faster the mixer things, the metal springs go.  And yeah, it's just used to help you bake stuff and to help you mix your baking materials,  Whether that be flour, egg, yolk, or whichever. It's just definitely made by hand for hand mixers.

tulip019,crankflashlight,2,"I'd took definitely it was a manual flashlight smaller than I expected it has like a hook on it where you could attach it either to your backpack or to your pants or whichever definitely used for you know exploring the wilderness or just being able to have a reliable flashlight that doesn't depend on batteries it has like a solar panel on the side of it and there's even an off and on button on the flashlight so just when you you spin it you crank it the light will turn on but you could also choose to turn it off and just still have it ready to go when you took switch flip the switch and yeah it has multiple LED lights on the light on the flashlight and definitely definitely break the object works does the mechanism on the side the plastic the more you spin it I guess the more energy you get in that light flash crank flashlight and the light will just turn on how it works yeah it's paneled solar charge and definitely the more you rotate it the more energy it would have and the longer it will be for you and yeah"
tulip019,fishingreel,1,"A fishing reel it is going to be another manual mechanism that fishers use to fish. It is connected  by a very long, very long strings. Those strings are definitely like either made of metal or like really hard like plastic that are made to be in the water  and once you you use the spring, the fishing reel, then when you do get a catch and basically all the the line extends all the way as much as you need or as long as it has or however long it is and once you do get a catch you rotate this the wheel counterclockwise and it just rolls back into the roll and the fishing reel and yeah there's also a crank it is definitely for part attached to a fishing rod. How the object works and what it's used for is for Fishing it is attached to a fishing rod so that real fishing reel is the main part of the fishing rod and because it is attached to all the string that you you need when you fish and when you do catch eat that string just brings back the fish whichever once you rotate it the counterclockwise. Uhm"
tulip019,fishingreel,2," What it looks like, it's made of metal. It's definitely supposed to be attached to a fishing rod.  It has a whole wheel of metal, a wheel that is surrounded by string.  The string could extend very, very long. I don't know how far it could be, probably maybe 500 yards, which I'm not sure.  But yeah, there is a crank on the right and the more you spin it, the more of the line you get.  And if you spin it the counterclockwise, that line will return back into the wheel, the wheel.  So it will go inwards and outwards and yeah, it is definitely supposed to be attached to a fishing rod.  As this object works, it's the tool that's attached to a fishing rod and it is used to hold all the string that's in that fishing reel. And that string is just what catches your fish once you do have one attached to your hook and then you just rotate the fishing reel counterclockwise and it will retrieve back all the lost string."
tulip019,stethoscope,1,"This looks like the tool that doctors use to hear your heartbeat. I assume there would be a metal and some rubber lining of it where it's attached to a metal  spring where you put it on your heart and with the stethoscope, you can hear your heartbeat  and the rhythm and just the beats for rhythms, beat for a minute.  And yeah, it is just something that doctors use to check your heartbeat.  What it's used for, it is used for to measure your heartbeat and to see how fast your heart is beating.  It is just a tool that, you know, for in the hospitals or whichever EMTs, doctors, but  yeah, they would move that metal thing that is attached to the stethoscope and it will just... they will place it on your heart and they will listen in closely as to how fast your heart is beating."

I think this Rolodex might be a toy watch, I'm gonna go with that, and could be used to like playing with time or learning how like what the time is. It's probably used for a... It's like a watch toy that children maybe use to like learn the time."

tulip020,shoehorn,2,"um this object's made of metal and i think like typically they're made of like either metal or plastic maybe metal is more often because it's so it doesn't break i still think the shoe horn is used for putting on like helping you put your shoe on so instead of like hurting your finger while sliding your shoe on it's easier just to glide your heel down the shoe horn and it'll push your shoe in or put your foot in"

It says 2 HD on it."
tulip020,bulbplanter,1,"I'm going to say a bulb planter…  It kind of reminds me, no, it might be like something, okay, I'm going to say it's rubber  and I think it looks like you have like a ball on top and a little thin, narrow thing. So like opening towards the bottom that you can help like squeeze the ball and it sections up things and then when you push the ball it like squeezes it out.  Is my guess, oh, I literally said everything in one. I don't know how this actually works. I think you use it to section up liquids and whatnot. I don't know. That didn't sound rubber so."
tulip020,bulbplanter,2," So, a bulb planter is made of metal, and it's silver, and the top half of it is like, okay, the top half of it is like two handles that come out, and you have, they connect in the middle.  One side you can press inwards, so you can use your thumb to press inwards to make the bottom half of, the bottom half of that looks like a silver claw with measurements on the side.  This object might be either used for out, no, I, maybe outdoor for planting, but also maybe in the kitchen for cooking.  I'm not sure how much, if it's like a meat thing, but there's a clamp, so, I don't know. Perfect."
tulip020,crankflashlight,1," I'm gonna say the crank flashlight is made of plastic with a handle that comes out so you can rotate the flashlight to make the, so if there's like no batteries in the flashlight or batteries run out, I'm assuming the crank, I keep getting ahead of myself, but plastic and a HD light.  I'm gonna say the crank flashlight is made of plastic with a handle that comes out so you can rotate the flashlight to make the flashlight turn on, and you have to continuously crank it so you can keep the flashlight going to like shine towards whatever you're looking at in the dark."
tulip020,crankflashlight,2," It's made of plastic, and it has also a green...  I don't even know what shape that is, like kind of rectangle shape, with a UV sensor so it can be charged by the sun. And then there's a little crank that comes out the side of it that you can rotate around. But there's also a slide button that you can just slide upwards and the flashlight will turn on on the side. And there's also a little clip at the handle where you can clip onto your pants or jacket or backpack. This object works as if you slide the on button on and then there will be a light that flashes out. So in case it could be used in the dark. If you're camping or just looking for something or if there's like in case of an emergency like you have a flashlight on deck so you can see in the dark."
tulip020,stethoscope,1,"looks like a little looks like a rubber rope and it has one end has a circle I'm thinking of the right thing of metal and it's flat but has like a 3d dimension of so you can hold on to it but it's not the front half is flat and it connects to the rest of them where the other end has two outward things this is what doctors use when they check people's heartbeats I think and to see if"
tulip020,stethoscope,2,"um so that is made of metal and it's also made of a electric rubber definitely the metal parts are on both ends of the stethoscope. One end has a flat circle with a like three dimension mini circle on the outside so you can hold on to it while you place it on someone's chest oops and the other end has two metal pieces with two rubber things to protect your ears because those go in your ears and they also go around to like so yeah. And it's used in hospitals mostly to check patients heartbeats to see if everything oh heartbeat and lungs I'm pretty sure to make sure there's no water in the lungs and then heartbeats to see if there's like a regular beating heart I'm pretty sure it's what they're used for"

It's like a claw in a way, I think. Reel. It's either the claw at the bottom of a fishing rod or it's the reel. Reel. Or it's the string that holds against the rod. I don't know. I think that it works by you... Something with fishing and helping it not break the rod. When you're reeling...  Oh, the fishing reel is the rotating part that helps you bring the fish in. Yeah. That's what it's called. It's the rotating crank that reels the fish in when you're fishing. Okay. Yep."
tulip020,fishingreel,2," So it's made of metal and it looks like this kind of, there's a crank on the side that you can rotate and then the front half of it is the part that it moves up and down as you rotate. I don't know why but it has also a metal bar that flips outwards that becomes a lock if you flip it upwards and when you flip it down it unlocks and then helps reel in the fish.  On the front half there's then clear twine which is used for the, I'm assuming is the, what is that called?  Twine for the bait, I don't know.  Or maybe it just helps it, I don't know what it helps but yeah there's a part at the bottom that comes out. That's also a metal that you can like hold onto that might connect to some part of the fishing rod.  To use for fishing is to help bring in the fish and for, yeah, to keep the rod from breaking I think and it just brings the fish in."

Um the circular piece at the bottom may be spun in two different directions for two different sound signals. This object works to allow for hearing audio um through the base of the object. Typically used in the medical field to listen to things like heartbeat during things like cardiac exams or um taking heart rate and pulse as well."
tulip022,stethoscope,2,"This object typically has two um metal branches that are covered in the top with rubber to go into ears. The place that they meet at a long tube extends down into a second piece that is circular with a large circular base and a smaller circle on top. Has usually metal framing and the tube connecting the two pieces is typically coated in rubber. This object works to hear um things like heart rates or abnormal breathing patterns by placing the metal drum at the end of the extension onto a patient or someone who is desired to be heard and is then heard up the tube into the ear pieces. Typically used in the medical field for cardiac exams, lung exams, and heart rate."
tulip022,floppydisk,1,"I'm unsure what the object is typically made of but I would think that it is typically circular in shape, potentially made out of plastic or some sort of metal material. Not sure how this object works or what it made be used for aside from maybe storing information."
tulip022,floppydisk,2,"This object is typically um square shaped and mainly made up of plastic despite small metal components that mainly serve the microchip function. This object works to store information mainly encoded by laptops such as somewhere else where they can be inserted such as on the hard drive and this works with the microchip and typically used for file storage and yeah."
tulip022,shoehorn,1,"This object is typically longer and skinny with a handle at the top potentially made out of plastic. It’s usually curved at the edges with a sort of knock for heels to fit in. It’s typically longer to avoid having to pin down for application uses. This object is used for um easier application for putting shoes on. It’s typically placed at the back of the shoe at the heel where you can use the knock in the tool to slide your heel in the shoes for easier foot insertion."
tulip022,shoehorn,2,"The object is typically made out of some sort of metal with a skinnier base for where your hand goes and a little bit longer base that gets a little bit wider for um heels to fit into the base.

tulip022,bloodpressure,2," The object typically has a fabric piece that wraps around and has Velcro on the ends to secure together, typically made out of different durable fabrics like nylon. It connects to a bottom hand pump through rubber tubing. This hand pump is also made out of rubber and shaped like a bulb with a disc on it that allows for the release or the intake of air. This object works by using the hand pump to pump air.  This is a very simple method, which tightens the fabric strapped around a patient's arm, typically used in the medical field for measuring blood pressure.  It works by pumping as much air to the desired higher blood pressure limit, and then the disc on the hand bulb is slightly open to release the pressure and calculate the correct values on the dial. Typically used in combination with a stethoscope."
tulip023,fishingreel,1,"A wire with a hook and a knot at the end. The hook is usually sharp and there's also... Like weights that are attached. As well as like a styrofoam like ball. Or with like a plastic... Stick in between it. And... The edge of the reel is either plastic or wooden. With like a handle. Maybe made out of rubber. There's metal. There's also metal hooks around. Where the plastic... Like... Strike or reel would be passing through. There is a hand monitor like spinning Contraption essentially like spins the reel to either push it further outwards or collect it inwards. Um... And it's made out of like a bendy material. and people often will attach bait at the end of the hook attached to the reel and throw like extend um the reel into the water in like a throwing motion um the styrofoam will then float on top of the water the hook itself attached with the bait um and the little weight will bring the bait a bit lower into the water um making it more attractive to fish to lure to catch um and if the styrofoam ball um goes deeper into the water it means that there's either a fish at the edge um nibbling on the bait or even caught onto the hook itself there would be like tension on the reel and then um the person handling the fishing reel would then go ahead and bring in the fish by moving in like a counterclockwise motion with the handle attached to like the contraption that brings in the reel like the spinning thing um yeah"
tulip023,fishingreel,2,"Um so the object is made out of this like plastic material. Not carbon fiber but kind of similar.  It's gray. It has a knob, like a handle for people to kind of move either clockwise or anti-clockwise.  There's a knob that has a collection of all the plastic fishing, like string. Not too sure what it's called. There's like a metallic rod kind of that surrounds it. It's like a semicircle. The knob itself moves in a circular motion.  And there's like a lever, which I believe can be used to release more of the string that the bait is usually attached to. Or like stop it from moving.  So in either direction, I believe that happens. Yeah. The object I'm presuming would be typically used to control the like tension of like the fishing string itself. As well as like where it is. So if it's being collected. Or if it's being released. It also makes like fishing significantly easier. So people don't have to like physically tug on like the fishing rod to bring like the bait or the fish that's been caught back in.  So instead, like your hand is moving in that like direction. So that's a good thing. To bring in assistance with the fishing reel itself to bring back whatever you've caught or if you haven't caught anything. Um.  And there's the handle at the end of the reel, which I'm presuming just makes it more comfortable to hold, especially when it might be like a bigger fish. Um. And maybe eases like the tension. Um. Of the fish itself. Um. Yeah."
tulip023,threeholepunch,1,"Um I’m not entirely sure what this is but I’m presuming it’s just like a hole puncher for paper. Um which is typically made out of either plastic or like a mix of plastic metal. There’s like a metal kind of like ruler with a bent edge that like allows you to place the holes in like the center of the paper. Um there’s these two or in this case like 3 blades. Um they’re kind of slanted and eventually when pressure is placed on the lever of like the object it allows it to cut through paper and create holes. Um the object itself has like springs and is like rectangular and kind of looks like an angle of sort, like a triangle without the last line if that makes sense? And then there’s that lever at the very top and then the three holes, the three like hold blades. And the edge is kind of like a sandwich so there’s like a plastic base attached to the metal rod I mentioned before and then the blade’s inside. And then on top of the blades the plastic handle or lever which you push down to use. Um the object is used to create holes in paper which can then be used for like storage purposes or keeping in a binder. Um and it can be used for crafts um but usually is more like an office, something you’d typically find in an office um. Yeah."
tulip023,threeholepunch,2,"Um so basically it’s more of like a long rectangle um office material made out of plastic and metal. There are three springs, a main lever which is essentially like the top part of the plastic component of the object and the bottom kind of like a sandwich of it which creates a plastic base and a solid like structure for the paper to be pierced um there’s three blades in not exactly a circular shape, they’re kind of angled blades and so the paper would be pierced in like a certain order if that makes sense to then create a pierced circular shape. There are these metal rods, three of them which are in the object. Attached are the springs which allow the top rectangular lever to be pushed so they can pierce the paper. Um there’s no metal rod that I mentioned before there’s no measurement for what you’re like piercing and it’s pretty heavy um. Yeah. This object would be used to pierce paper creating three holes. It would be found in an office again. And it would be used in the sense where you would place a sheet of paper or multiple sheets of paper at the very bottom so right at the bottom rectangular piece of plastic and top rectangular lever. You’d place it flat on a table, place the sheet of paper and push down with significant pressure to create those three holes with the blades I previously mentioned. And yeah, the aim of the object is essentially to create holes which then you can use the paper for storing in a binder or maybe like an arts and crafts project maybe"

tulip023,frenchpress,2," So, the object is a plastic cylinder with a plastic lid.  The cylinder also has, like, a spout at the end for which liquid can pass through.  The plastic lid blocks that spout, and the center of the lid is attached to, like, a metal rod with a plastic knob, sort of like handle. Um  Which moves in, like, an upward-downward motion.  The rod itself has, like, no gap in the cylindrical lid, so nothing or any liquid wouldn't be able to, like, escape.  Attached to the object itself is a plastic handle, which isn't, like, plexiglass like the cylinder itself.  It's, like, plastic, like, black plastic.  The bottom of the object also is, like, made out of that plexiglass material that the rest of the cylinder has.  Attached to the bottom of the rod of the one that's, like, in the center of the lid that moves upward and downwards is some sort of, like, a sieve. With a metal pattern.  There's, like, a solid piece of metal on top of the sieve that has gaps where you can see the actual sieve itself. There's also what looks like a spring in the shape of a circle on top of that sieve with the metal.  So when you were to lift the rod from the plastic, like, knob at the top... It would move up and down. Um... And...  There's enough space at the bottom where that plexiglass was that I mentioned before where you'd be able to, like, fit coffee and then, like, water so you can steep the coffee or brew it. Um... This object is...  Used as, like, a brewing technique for coffee.  I'm presuming you would put in the coffee, the dry coffee at the bottom and then add in hot water and steep it, like, move it downwards. Um...  And then you'd be able to pour that coffee out once it's, like, fully brewed. Um...  I'm presuming it's, like, a more effective way or specific technique.  That gives, like, an enhanced flavor of the coffee, um, compared to, like, typical brewing or maybe, like, instant coffee. Um...  Maybe it creates, like, a finer texture in the liquid because it's being run through a sieve so maybe the coffee is, like, more pure. Um... It also might be used to get as much...  Liquid out as possible since you're compressing all the, like, solid material at the bottom of the cylinder. You get as much liquid as you could possibly be able to get. Um... Yeah."

tulip023,rolodex,2,"Uh this object is like a cylindrical kind of rod attached to another curved rod that also has two like rubber stickers so it’s able to stand up on a flat surface and you can move the cylinder with these two like knobs that are placed at the ends. On the cylinder itself um there are hooks or like spirals which you can attach cards. The cards are in two colors, blue and red, uh blue and white. And the blue cards they have these like tabs where you can see in alphabetical order what you’re like looking at, um and yeah the object can be moved in either direction either backwards or forwards using the knobs to flip the papers that you’re seeing towards you or away from you. It’s kind of like an automatic page flipper and um due to the like rubber stickers placed at the bottom which keeps the structure up, it’s very steady so it doesn’t move when you flip the cards with like the knobs. It’s used for organizing flashcards, studying, um creating lists um maybe like placing things into categories, alphabetical categories. Listing words, listing objects, creating an inventory, studying. I’m presuming it’s very helpful in places like a library. This may be a more traditional like way of storing information um aside from like a data base. It allows for easy identification of whatever you’re looking for. Um it’s something that is small so you can look up information very easily. It’s effective so you can be exposed to like different lists or whatever specific category you’re looking for. The color allows for you to identify what you’re looking for very quickly.
