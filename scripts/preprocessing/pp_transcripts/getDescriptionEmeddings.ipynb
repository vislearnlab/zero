It consists of a hand crank that, when turned, rotates a set of metal beaters or whisks through a gear mechanism. The gears convert the rotary motion of the handle into faster rotation of the beaters, allowing for efficient mixing with manual power. Often made of stainless steel with a comfortable grip handle, these mixers are particularly useful for whipping cream, beating eggs, or mixing batters in situations without electricity. Some models feature interchangeable beaters and adjustable speeds through different gear ratios.\",\n          \"An office tool used to create uniform holes in paper for storage in ring binders. It uses a lever mechanism that drives metal punches through paper, creating three evenly-spaced holes. The punches compress and cut the paper against a die, while a confetti tray catches the paper circles. Most models include paper guides and adjustable punch patterns. Heavy-duty versions can punch through dozens of sheets simultaneously.\",\n          \"Scissors are handheld cutting tools consisting of two metal blades pivoted together at a central point. They have two looped handles, usually made of plastic or metal, designed for gripping. When the handles are squeezed together, the sharp edges of the blades slide past each other, creating a cutting action. The blades can be straight or slightly curved, with some featuring serrated edges for specific tasks. Scissors are used for a wide range of cutting applications, from household and office tasks to specialized uses in sewing, crafting, and medical procedures. Kitchen scissors help cut food, while heavy-duty shears can handle tougher materials like fabric, cardboard, or plastic. There are also child-safe scissors with rounded tips designed for young users. The simple yet effective mechanism of scissors makes them essential in everyday life, offering precision and ease when cutting paper, thread, hair, and various other materials.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get embeddings\n","results = []\n","for idx, row in df.iterrows():\n","    object_name = row['object_name']\n","    description = row['description']\n","\n","    if pd.isna(description) or not description:\n","        continue\n","\n","    print(f\"Processing {object_name}...\")\n","\n","    # Chunk the description\n","    chunks = chunk_by_sentences(description, tokenizer, max_tokens=77, overlap_sentences=1)\n","\n","    # Get embeddings for chunks\n","    chunk_embeddings = get_embeddings_for_chunks(chunks, tokenizer, model, device)\n","\n","    # Average embeddings\n","    avg_embedding = average_embeddings(chunk_embeddings)\n","\n","    results.append({\n","        'object_name': object_name,\n","        'description': description,\n","        'embedding': avg_embedding.tolist()\n","    })\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"k7-aZHoPZN73","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752018305633,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1136,"user":{"displayName":"A.J.

They have two looped handles, usually made of plastic or metal, designed for gripping. When the handles are squeezed together, the sharp edges of the blades slide past each other, creating a cutting action. The blades can be straight or slightly curved, with some featuring serrated edges for specific tasks. Scissors are used for a wide range of cutting applications, from household and office tasks to specialized uses in sewing, crafting, and medical procedures. Kitchen scissors help cut food, while heavy-duty shears can handle tougher materials like fabric, cardboard, or plastic. There are also child-safe scissors with rounded tips designed for young users.

It consists of a hand crank that, when turned, rotates a set of metal beaters or whisks through a gear mechanism. The gears convert the rotary motion of the handle into faster rotation of the beaters, allowing for efficient mixing with manual power. Often made of stainless steel with a comfortable grip handle, these mixers are particularly useful for whipping cream, beating eggs, or mixing batters in situations without electricity. Some models feature interchangeable beaters and adjustable speeds through different gear ratios.\",\n          \"An office tool used to create uniform holes in paper for storage in ring binders. It uses a lever mechanism that drives metal punches through paper, creating three evenly-spaced holes. The punches compress and cut the paper against a die, while a confetti tray catches the paper circles. Most models include paper guides and adjustable punch patterns. Heavy-duty versions can punch through dozens of sheets simultaneously.\",\n          \"Scissors are handheld cutting tools consisting of two metal blades pivoted together at a central point. They have two looped handles, usually made of plastic or metal, designed for gripping. When the handles are squeezed together, the sharp edges of the blades slide past each other, creating a cutting action. The blades can be straight or slightly curved, with some featuring serrated edges for specific tasks. Scissors are used for a wide range of cutting applications, from household and office tasks to specialized uses in sewing, crafting, and medical procedures. Kitchen scissors help cut food, while heavy-duty shears can handle tougher materials like fabric, cardboard, or plastic. There are also child-safe scissors with rounded tips designed for young users. The simple yet effective mechanism of scissors makes them essential in everyday life, offering precision and ease when cutting paper, thread, hair, and various other materials.\"\n        ],\n
