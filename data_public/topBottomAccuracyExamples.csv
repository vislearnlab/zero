Like I remember like the ones we used to have in like our elementary school classrooms. It was like a long metal piece and it was rectangular and it had like two sides and there on one side was the actual hole punching side. So you had like the three holes that would line up to a standard like printer piece of paper and then you'd press down on the opposite side and it would hole punch the paper and then there was like a little tray underneath where it collected all the pieces and you had to empty it out. So this object is used for hole punching paper to make it easier to put into like binders  or like some kind of like, yeah, mostly like binders or like filing systems that like require  binders, but you basically push the piece down and it hole punches, push the opposite piece down and it hole punches the sides.",0.59222386224047,0.894639073307056

And typically how it works is that if you click down on something, on the paper then the holes punch out and then what it’s used for is to punch out holes in a paper so that you can put it in a binder.",0.552805318914082,0.844349915909073
289,tulip016,1,threeholepunch," Okay, so a three-hole punch is a rectangular object. It is longer than the length of a typical printer paper. I'd say it's typically about a foot and a couple of inches longer.  Wait, no, no, no, no, no. That's incorrect. It is longer than the length of printer paper. That's true.  It's typically made of two metal, two rectangular pieces of metal. All of the hole punchers that I've seen have had the color black.  And then on the inside, there is a section for you to, there is a section to line up paper. And then there are three metal prongs. And there is a spring mechanism inside of the two metal bars so that the two metal bars are permanently at an angle so that the bars are only touching on one side that is the long length side. Okay.  So a three-hole punch, three-hole punch tool is used to punch three holes into paper.  People do this for school or for work or for just organizing papers that they have for binders, typically. Or some a sort of a folder that has prongs in it for you to put paper into to store. So you would insert paper into the three-hole punch. And then you would press down on the top metal bar and you would hear a crunch. And that would be the three prongs punching three holes into the paper of a standardized size. Okay. That fits majority of binders.  And so you would just put in some papers, maybe put in a stack of papers, punch the hole, and then you would use the papers for the binder or whatever you're putting your papers into.

451,tulip024,1,threeholepunch,it is like it's its length is about the size of a piece of paper like like 18 inches I think and there's three three little things that you can put the paper into to hole punch it it's like sharp sharp circular thing and there's springs you just like press the side of it to lift the springs up and then release it and like the pressure is enough to use the sharp parts of it to cut the paper and hole punch it so you can like put it in a binder or something it works by the springs make enough pressure to that the little sharp things can cut through paper really easily and it's so you can have three holes in the paper to attach a bunch of papers together,0.288798713244747,0.507537121060702

There’s like a metal kind of like ruler with a bent edge that like allows you to place the holes in like the center of the paper. Um there’s these two or in this case like 3 blades.
